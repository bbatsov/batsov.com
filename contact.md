## General Notes

I'd be really glad to hear from you, if you want to talk
about:

* content on the site (e.g. share some feedback about an article I wrote)
* any of my OSS projects
* presentations I gave
* any topic that is of interest to me (if you know/follow me, you definitely know what they are)

I'll likely ignore messages:

* from random recruiters who are interested in my (non-existing) React.js and PHP skills
* that are hostile and non-constructive

## Getting in Touch

The best way to reach me is via email. I love email and rarely bother to check
messages on LinkedIn (and social media in general). More details below.

### Email

Feel free to contact me first name at `batsov.net` or `hey.com` about anything.
It's a great place for private constructive conversations.

I can heartily recommend Fastmail to everyone looking for a great email service
that respects your privacy. Using my [affiliate link to sign up](https://ref.fm/u26676944) will give you a 10% discount for the first year.

### GitHub

The best place to collaborate on any of my OSS projects is GitHub. I welcome all
contributions, no matter how small they are.

My projects are spread over several GitHub accounts:

* [Personal Projects](https://github.com/bbatsov)
* [RuboCop HQ](https://github.com/rubocop-hq)
* [Clojure Emacs](https://github.com/clojure-emacs)
* [nREPL](https://github.com/nrepl)

Feel free to also send PRs addressing the many typos and bad English grammar in [this blog](https://github.com/bbatsov/think.batsov.com).

### Twitter

Twitter is the only social media that I like and use frequently. It's a great place for sharing quick feedback, shout-outs, etc.

### Blog Comments

For reasons outlined [here]({% post_url 2021-11-02-blog-comments-are-dead %}) I've removed comments from this blog.

I keep an eye on the traffic coming to the blog, so if my articles end up on
Reddit, HackerNews, etc, I'll likely notice this and join the conversation there.

### LinkedIn

I accept most invitations to connect, but I rarely respond to any messages there.
If you want to get my attention on LinkedIn you'll have to try really hard. Emails
work a lot better!
