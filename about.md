## About Me

![Bozhidar](/assets/images/bozhidar_presenting1.jpg)

I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on GitHub, contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp [projects](/projects/).

The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
[conference talks](/presentations/). I love speaking at conferences
and I'm really bad at it![^3]

## About (think)

This site was my first attempt to write. I failed miserably and I produced some pretty
crappy content, but I also learned a lot in the process.

These days most of my writing happens at [Meta Redux](https://metaredux.com), but
I still post here things that are worth sharing, but don't fit the overall
vision of Meta Redux. Not to mention that my vision for (think) and Meta Redux
changes quite often.

I guess I'll mostly be writing here on programming-related topics, but who knows...
Knowing me there's a high chance I won't actually write anything at all!

## About My Other Blogs

I have a small problem with blogs - I've created way too many of them!
I already mentioned above Meta Redux, but there are actually more!

### Emacs Redux

I run a separate blog focused on Emacs, that you might want to check
out as well - [Emacs Redux](http://emacsredux.com).

### HEY World

I also have a blog at [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/bozhidar).
I'm still not sure what I'll use it for (if anything), but most likely it
will host short musings on random non-technical topics.

## Colophon

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses
the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

The comments are powered by the privacy-focused service [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com).
One way to support my work is to sign up for Hyvor via my [affiliate link](https://talk.hyvor.com?aff=14023).

I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days (circa 2021) I'm a Windows 10 (with WSL2) user most of the time.  When I'm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C)[^4].  When I'm on
the road I do (or don't do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard[^5].

The source code of the site is freely available at [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov/think.batsov.com).

[^1]: Божидар in Bulgarian. I know, I know - that's both pretty hard to read and to pronounce. My friends call me Bug and so can you.
[^2]: Especially Lisps! And Unix-like operating systems! And Emacs! And video games!
[^3]: But at least I'm honest with myself.
[^4]: Also known as the "best keyboard ever". Seriously!
[^5]: Also known as the "worst keyboard ever". No shit!
