## About Me

![Bozhidar](/assets/images/bozhidar.jpg)

I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on GitHub, contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp [projects](/projects/).

The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
[conference talks](/presentations/). I love speaking at conferences
and I'm really bad at it![^3]

## About (think)

This site was my first attempt to write. I failed miserably and I produced some pretty
crappy content, but I also learned a lot in the process.

These days most of my writing happens at [Meta Redux](https://metaredux.com), but
I still plan to post here things that are worth sharing, but don't fit the overall
idea of Meta Redux.

I guess I'll mostly be writing on programming-related topics, but who knows...
Knowing me there's a high chance I won't actually write anything at all!

## Emacs Redux

I run a separate blog focused on Emacs, that you might want to check
out as well - [Emacs Redux](http://emacsredux.com).

## Colophon

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses
the [Hydeout theme](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout).

I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days I'm a macOS user most of the time.  When I'm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C)[^4].  When I'm on
the road I do (or don't do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard[^5].

The source code of the site is freely available at [GitHub](//github.com/bbatsov/think.batsov.com).

[^1]: Божидар in Bulgarian. I know, I know - that's both pretty hard to read and to pronounce. My friends call me Bug and so can you.
[^2]: Especially Lisps! And Unix-like operating systems! And Emacs! And video games!
[^3]: But at least I'm honest with myself.
[^4]: Also known as the "best keyboard ever". Seriously!
[^5]: Also known as the "worst keyboard ever". No shit!
