I love free software and I do a fair share of work on free software projects.
Most of my projects are in the realms of Clojure, Ruby and Emacs and aim to
help software engineers be more productive.

My projects are spread over several GitHub accounts:

* [Personal Projects](https://github.com/bbatsov)
* [RuboCop HQ](https://github.com/rubocop)
* [Clojure Emacs](https://github.com/clojure-emacs)
* [nREPL](https://github.com/nrepl)

## Highlights

Here's a brief run-down of my (somewhat) popular projects.[^1]

### Ruby

* [RuboCop](http://rubocop.org) (linter/code formatter for Ruby)
* [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop/ruby-style-guide)
* [Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop/rails-style-guide)
* [RSpec Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop/rspec-style-guide)
* [Minitest Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop/minitest-style-guide)

### Clojure

These days (circa 2018) Clojure free software work consumes most of my
time and energy.

I'm the author of a few projects:

* [CIDER](https://cider.mx) (powerful Clojure interactive development environment for Emacs)
* [cider-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl) (nREPL middleware for Clojure editors and IDEs)
* [orchard](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard) (essential functionality for Clojure development tools, used internally by `cider-nrepl`)
* [incomplete](https://github.com/nrepl/incomplete) (a simple Clojure code completion library)
* [inf-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure) (basic Clojure interactive development environment for Emacs)

And the primary maintainer or a co-maintainer of a ton of commonly
used tools and libraries focused at creating powerful Clojure editing
experience:

* [nREPL](https://nrepl.xyz) (a network REPL server)
* [Piggieback](https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback) (ClojureScript support for nREPL)
* [Drawbridge](https://github.com/nrepl/drawbridge) (HTTP support for nREPL)
* [Fastlane](https://github.com/nrepl/fastlane) (Transit support for nREPL)
* [cljs-tooling](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cljs-tooling)
* [clj-refactor](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor)
* [refactor-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl)
* [compliment](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/) (the ultimate Clojure code completion library)
* [sayid](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/sayid) (Clojure tracer/debugger)
* [clojuredocs-edn-export](https://clojuredocs-edn.netlify.app/) (daily EDN exports of the data from <https://clojuredocs.org>)
* [parseclj](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/parseclj) (Clojure parser written in Emacs Lisp)
* [parseedn](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/parseedn) (EDN parser written in Emacs Lisp)

### Emacs

Emacs is the One True Editor and my biggest life-long obsession. You can safely describe
me as an unreasonable (but powerful) Emacs wielding fanatic!

* [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) (an Emacs distribution)
* [Projectile](https://projectile.mx) (project management and navigation package)
* [Crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux) (a collection of useful Emacs commands)
* [super-save](https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save) (auto-save your work when moving around)
* [guru-mode](https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode) (helps you remember the basic Emacs keybindings)
* [rubocop-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop-emacs)
* [Zenburn theme for Emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs)
* [Solarized theme for Emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs)
* [adoc-mode](https://github.com/emacsorphanage/adoc-mode)
* [Flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck)
* [Flycheck OCaml](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-ocaml)

You can find my personal Emacs configuration [here](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d/).

## Meta Redux

Since 2018 I have a dedicated blog, named [Meta Redux](https://metaredux.com), for my OSS work.

## Support Me

Working on free software projects is a lot of fun, but it also takes a
lot of time and energy. I'd love to be able to turn my free software
hobby work into my job, but I'll need a lot of help from you to get
there!

If you like my work, consider supporting it via one of following funding platforms:

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/users/bbatsov/sponsorship)
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bbatsov)
* [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/bbatsov)

Thanks!
