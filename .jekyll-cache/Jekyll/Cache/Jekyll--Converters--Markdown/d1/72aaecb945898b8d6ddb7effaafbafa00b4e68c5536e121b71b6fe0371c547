I"|<p>I’m mostly a Ruby on Rails developer these days and as such I’m pretty
fond of the <a href="http://slim-lang.com">Slim template language</a>. I’ve
always hated HTML + ERB, since that evil duo encourages all sorts of
ever practices and recently I’ve adopted Slim as a replacement for
my long time favourite ERB alternative - <a href="http://haml-lang.com">Haml</a>.</p>
