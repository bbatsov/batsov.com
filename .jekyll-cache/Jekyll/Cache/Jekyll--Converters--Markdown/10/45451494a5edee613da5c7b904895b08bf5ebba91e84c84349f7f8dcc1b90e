I"^<p>Iâ€™ve always been frustrated with the inability to write a switch on
String in Java.  However the enum type introduced in Java 5.0 somewhat
diminishes the issue. Read this excellent
<a href="http://www.xefer.com/2006/12/switchonstring">article</a> on the subject.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Java 7 now supports switch on String!</p>
