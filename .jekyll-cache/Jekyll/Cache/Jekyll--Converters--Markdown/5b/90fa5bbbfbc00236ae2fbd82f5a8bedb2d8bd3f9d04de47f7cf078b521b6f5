I"®<p>Most of you probably have heard that Fedora 13 will feature
experimental 3D support for the Nouveau open source driver for Nvidia
cards. This support, however, is not enabled by default. To enable it
you need to install the mesa-dri-drivers-experimental package. I,
personally, do it like this(if you havenâ€™t configured sudo, youâ€™ll
have to perform this as root):</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>yum <span class="nb">install </span>mesa-dri-drivers-experimental
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Afterwards you can enable Compuz, play chromium-bsu or whatever your heart desires.</p>
