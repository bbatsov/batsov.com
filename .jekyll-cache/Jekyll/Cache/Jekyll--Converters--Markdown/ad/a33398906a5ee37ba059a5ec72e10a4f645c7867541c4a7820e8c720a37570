I"5<p>From time to time you might want to void (unbind) a variable or a
function definition in Emacs. Most often you’ll probably be dealing
with variables created with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defvar</code> whose values you’ll want to
update.  The magic functions you need are the following:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; this will make the symbol my-nasty-variable's value void</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">makunbound</span> <span class="ss">'my-nasty-variable</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">;; this will make the symbol my-nasty-function's</span>
<span class="c1">;; function definition void</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">fmakunbound</span> <span class="ss">'my-nasty-function</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The names aren’t exactly intuitive and even I happen to forget them from time to
time. Now at least I’ll now where to look for them if that happens
again.</p>
