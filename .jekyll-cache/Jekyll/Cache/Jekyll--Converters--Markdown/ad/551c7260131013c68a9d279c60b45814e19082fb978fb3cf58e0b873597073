I"Ë<p>Getting started with Emacs is hard. Thatâ€™s a fact of life and you
shouldnâ€™t believe anyone telling you otherwise.</p>

<p>One of the harder parts of the journey to Emacs mastery is remembering
all those keybindings at the beginning (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-h t</code>), which can be really
overwhelming. To make matters worse for many common commands there are
two sets of keybindings - the Emacs ones (that are touch typing
friendly) and the popular ones (that typically involve the use of the
arrow keys). Most people never get to use the <em>proper</em> keybindings and
forever make use of the arrow keys.</p>

<p>To help Emacs newcomers get used to the proper Emacs keybindings Iâ€™ve
created <a href="http://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode">guru-mode</a> - a simple
minor mode that will show you a (helpful) message in the minibuffer
every time you try to use a <em>non Emacs way</em> keybinding.</p>

<p>It will probably annoy you <strong>a lot</strong> in the beginning, but trust me -
itâ€™ll be worth it in the long run.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guru-mode</code> comes bundled with
<a href="http://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> and is available
for installation from <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org">Marmalade</a> and <a href="http://melpa.org">MELPA</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. True Emacs mastery cannot be achieved if you do not practice
touch typing; if youâ€™re doing hunt-and-peck typing youâ€™d better fire up the
venerable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gtypist</code> before looking at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guru-mode</code>.</p>
