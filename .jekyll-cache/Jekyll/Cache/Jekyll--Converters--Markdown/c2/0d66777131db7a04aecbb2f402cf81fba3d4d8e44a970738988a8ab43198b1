I"y<p>Sometimes you may want to start a couple of programs just after an
interactive login to your favourite shell, which in my case would be
zsh.</p>

<p>For example - I use Emacs as daemon process (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs --daemon</code>). I
cannot use an init script to start it since the daemon is usable on a
per user basis. The solution in this case is really simple - just
create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zlogin</code> file in your home folder and put in it all the
commands you want executed after you’ve logged into the shell. In my
case I put:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>emacs <span class="nt">--daemon</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>there and as soon as I’m logged in, the Emacs daemon is up and waiting for
incoming connections.</p>
