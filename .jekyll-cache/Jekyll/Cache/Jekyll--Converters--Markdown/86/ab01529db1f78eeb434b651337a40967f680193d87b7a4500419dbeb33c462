I"³<p>At <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> I had the chance to shake
Rich Hickeyâ€™s hand and exchange a few words with him. When I asked him
whether he currently uses CIDER or Cursive for Clojure development he
replied that he preferred a simpler solution â€“ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code> &amp;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inferior-lisp-mode</code>.</p>
