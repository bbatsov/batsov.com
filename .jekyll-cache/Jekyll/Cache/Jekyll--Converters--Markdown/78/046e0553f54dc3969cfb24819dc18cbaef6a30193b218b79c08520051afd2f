I"P<p>It’s been quite a while since my last blog post. There hasn’t been
much action on the open-source projects I happen to maintain
either. The reason for this is quite simple - recently I’ve joined the
ranks of the social trading start-up <a href="https://tradeo.com">Tradeo</a> and
things have been crazy at work ever since.</p>
