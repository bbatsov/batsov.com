I"˜<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to switch my work environment theme to
something with lower contrast (namely the excellent <a href="https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn">Zenburn
theme</a>). Swing applications,
however,have difficulties with GTK themes when they are using the GTK+
look &amp; feel, so Iâ€™ve decided to go to Nimbus â€“ the new default look &amp;
feel for Java apps since Java 6 Update 10.</p>
