I"Õ<p>As you know Iâ€™ve recently migrated my blog from WordPress to
Jekyll. One of the things I had to do was add an Atom feed(RSS
sucks). It was quite the easy task. I just had to create an
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/blog/blob/master/atom.xml">atom.xml</a> file
and place in the root of my blog.</p>

<p>Afterwards I only had to link my default layout to the atom feed:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"alternate"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"application/atom+xml"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"atom.xml"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"Atom feed"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point I was able to subscribe to my new atom feed(and
hopefully my followers(which I may or may not have) were able to do
the same).</p>
