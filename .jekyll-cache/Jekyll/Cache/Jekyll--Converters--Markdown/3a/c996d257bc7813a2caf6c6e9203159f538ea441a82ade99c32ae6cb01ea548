I".<p>This tip is going to be a really short one. Hopefully by now youâ€™ve
heard about <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">pry</a> - a fantastic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">irb</code>
replacement, that somewhat reminds me of the mighty Lisp REPLs. What
you might not know is how to hook it into Rails so that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails
console</code> (a.k.a. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails c</code>) command would fire a pry shell instead of
an irb one. There are several ways to do so, but I find one
particularly straightforward - the awesome little gem
<a href="https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails">pry-rails</a>.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Go ahead, install the little sucker and
enjoy your new pry-powered Rails console.</p>
