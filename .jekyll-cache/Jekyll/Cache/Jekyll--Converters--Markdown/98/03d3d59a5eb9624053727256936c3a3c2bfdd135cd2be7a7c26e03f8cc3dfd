I"Æ<p>One of the major problems when using
<a href="/articles/2012/10/14/emacs-on-osx/">Emacs on OS X</a> is
not related to OS X itself - the problem has to do with the Macâ€™s
hardware. Recent Mac keyboards(both laptop and desktop, with the
exception of the wired full size Mac keyboard) lack a right <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Control</code>
key and it happens to be extremely important if youâ€™re looking to
fully leverage the power of Emacs.</p>

<p>The traditional solution to the problem is to use a tool like
<a href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/">KeyRemap4MacBook</a> to remap
the right <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code> key to right <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Control</code> and to use a snippet like
this to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command</code> behave like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Meta</code> in Emacs:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">mac-command-modifier</span> <span class="ss">'meta</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works, but itâ€™s hardly ideal since youâ€™re remapping <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code> at
fairly low level and you wonâ€™t be able to use it anywhere as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>.</p>

<p>A much better idea would be to leverage a little know capability of
KeyRemap4MacBook (a great program which despite its name works with
desktop Macs as well) and map the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Return</code> key to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Control</code> only
when itâ€™s held down (it will behave like a normal Return key in all
other situations). The option youâ€™ll have to find in KeyRemap4MacBook
is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Change Return</code> section and it labeled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Return to Control_R
(+ When you type Return only, send Return)</code>.</p>

<p>This approach has several advantages.  First and foremost youâ€™re not
sacrificing a valuable key like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>. Second - itâ€™s much easier to
hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Return</code> with your right pinky than it is to hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code>
(especially if youâ€™re using a US layout keyboard - these have long
single row <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Return</code> keys, compared to the short 2 row Returns found on
European keyboards). Lastly, if youâ€™ve already remapped <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CapsLock</code> to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Control</code> (like so many people do) youâ€™re getting a pretty symmetrical
mapping on the opposite side of your keyboard.</p>

<p>All in all - remapping <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Return</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Control</code> is a huge win if youâ€™re
using heavily one of Appleâ€™s smaller keyboards. Of course, if you have
the option to use an external keyboard youâ€™d do yourself a solid if you
obtained a good full size keyboard like the
