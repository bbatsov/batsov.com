I"Ê<p>This post is mostly a note to myself, since I constantly forget how to
delete remote Git branches.</p>

<p>The classic way to do so (introduced in Git 1.5) would be:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git push origin :branch-to-delete
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, if I were migrating an application from MySQL to PostgreSQL I might want to delete
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">postgres</code> branch when Iâ€™m done:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git push origin :postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You have to agree this syntax is hardly something one can easily
remember(and Iâ€™m extra certain nobody would have guessed it on their
own). Fortunately in Git 1.7 a nicer alternative to the above command
was introduced:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git push origin <span class="nt">--delete</span> branch-to-delete
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Now go ahead and delete those unneeded Git branches.</p>

<p>P.S. GitHub users might also want to take a look at this

describing recently added functionality to clean up after pull
requests.</p>
