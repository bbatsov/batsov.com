I"<p>For many years I’ve enjoyed listening to programming podcasts - it’s
the perfect way to make a commute a bit more fun and
educational.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">RubyRogues</a> was always
one of my favourite Ruby shows and I find it very amusing that
recently I ended up being their guest. I certainly didn’t see this coming!
Seems that a lot has changed since the days I followed it actively, but it
was still fun to make an appearance there.</p>

      <p>Since I started working remotely I practically stopped listening to any podcasts. One of the few donwsides of remote work. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
