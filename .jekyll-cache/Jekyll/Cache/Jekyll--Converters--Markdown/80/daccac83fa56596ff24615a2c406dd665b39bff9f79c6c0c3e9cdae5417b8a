I"Á<p>Have you ever been wondering how to access the Emacs menu bar, when
using Emacs in console mode? The answer is easy - press <strong>F10</strong> or type
<strong>M-x menu-bar-open</strong>(both methods work in X as well, of course).</p>

<p>Although the menu bar is rarely used by seasoned Emacs veterans,
exploring it is a great way to get started with the capabilities of
the new modes, so being able to access it is generally a good thing.</p>
