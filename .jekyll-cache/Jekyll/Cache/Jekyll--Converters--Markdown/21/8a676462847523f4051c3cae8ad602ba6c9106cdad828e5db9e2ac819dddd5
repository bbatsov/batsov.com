I"÷<p><a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/">Zenburn</a> is a popular colour theme for
vim, developed by Jani Nurminen. Itâ€™s my personal
belief (and probably that of many of its users I presume) that itâ€™s one of the
best low contrast themes out there and that Zenburn is exceptionally
easy on the eyes. Btw, I love Zenburn so much that Iâ€™ve even created a
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/blog/blob/master/css/syntax.css">Zenburn theme for Jekyll</a> to be able to use for my blog.</p>
