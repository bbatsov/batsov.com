I"ö	<p>After 3 years of â€œwaitingâ€ for Octopress 3<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Iâ€™ve decided I waited
long enough.  Today I (spontaneously) migrated my blog to a vanilla
Jekyll setup and I tweaked a bit its appearance. Iâ€™m reasonably pleased
with the result and I finally donâ€™t have any excuses not to write.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I realized recently that it has been over 10 years since my first blog
post.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Iâ€™ve started my humble writing â€œcareerâ€ with Wordpress, then
switched to Octopress, and now here we are. One thing never really
changed, though - the quality of my writing. It was always abysmally
bad, as were many of the topics I wrote on. Itâ€™s really fun to look
back on all of this - I was reading some of my old articles, in the
process of migrating the blog to Jekyll, and I couldnâ€™t believe some of
the things I wrote. I hope this means Iâ€™m getting wiser with ageâ€¦</p>

<p>In the mean time Iâ€™ve started another blog, called <a href="https://metaredux.com">Meta
Redux</a>. I plan to do most of my (serious)
writing there, but I might write an occasional short article or two
here as well. My rough idea is to use Meta Redux as a platform for my
more creative writing, and to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(think)</code> for random stuff, small
tips, etc.</p>

<p>Anyways, lately Iâ€™ve had this burning desire to share so many thoughts
and that really got me excited about writing. Letâ€™s see if Iâ€™ll do
better this time around, or Iâ€™ll simply fail one more timeâ€¦</p>
