I"Ú<p>After dreading the migration of this site from Octopress 2 to Jekyll
for years, I finally found the will to do it today. The process was
actually very straight-forward and took me just a couple of hours
(most of which I spent trying to find new a theme for the site and
tweaking it afterwards).</p>

<h2 id="create-a-new-jekyll-blog">Create a new Jekyll Blog</h2>

<p>I think itâ€™s best to just create a blank Jekyll blog and move there
everything you need from your old blog.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>jekyll new jekyll-blog
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="copy-posts-and-assets-from-the-octopress-blog">Copy posts and assets from the Octopress blog</h2>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>octopress-blog
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> <span class="nb">source</span>/_posts path-to-jekyll-blog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should also copy whatever assets (e.g. images) you had in your
old blog to the new one. I like to keep the images under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/images</code>.</p>

<h2 id="remove-octopress-plugins">Remove Octopress Plugins</h2>

<p>Octopress shipped many <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/">plugins</a> that are not
available with Jekyll.</p>

<p>I was using in my posts a lot <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/blockquote/">http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/blockquote/</a> and
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/">http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/</a>, but replacing those was a trivial
mechanical process.</p>

<h2 id="preserve-the-old-links">Preserve the old links</h2>

<p>There was a small difference in the permalinks format of my old
Octopress blog and the new Jekyll blog. The old links looked like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://batsov.com/articles/2018/11/05/back-in-black/</code> and the new
links were like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://batsov.com/articles/2018/11/05/back-in-black.html</code>.</p>

<p>To preserve the old links I had to add this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">permalink</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title/"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="update-postss-front-matter">Update postsâ€™s front-matter</h2>

<p>Seems through the years something has changed in the semantics of
categories.  Back in the day I think this was just a synonym for tags,
but now categories are made part of the URLs (at least by
default). For some reason with Octopress I had used only categories in
my postsâ€™s front matter, so I had to rename those keys to tags.  I
also had to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">categories: articles</code> to all my posts to preserve their
old URL. Basically this:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Migrating from Octopress to Jekyll</span>
<span class="na">categories</span><span class="pi">:</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Jekyll</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Octopress</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Tutorial</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>became this:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Migrating from Octopress to Jekyll</span>
<span class="na">categories</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">articles</span>
<span class="na">tags</span><span class="pi">:</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Jekyll</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Octopress</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Tutorial</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not sure how good my approach was, but it got the job done.</p>

<p>As an alternative <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">articles</code> can simply be made part of the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">permalink</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">articles/:year/:month/:day/:title/"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="add-jekyll-compose">Add jekyll-compose</h2>

<p>Octopress had some nice rake tasks like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake new_post</code> that I was
found of. I noticed that out of the box Jekyll didnâ€™t have anything
like this, which was a bit frustrating. I quickly discovered the plugin <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose">jekyll-compose</a>
and itâ€™s even better than the old rake tasks. Hereâ€™s how you can create a new post with it:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll post <span class="s2">"New Post"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also use the plugin to manage your drafts, which I find extremely handy.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all there is to the migration! Now enjoy your wonderful new
blog and write some amazing articles for it! Iâ€™m looking forward to
reading them!</p>
