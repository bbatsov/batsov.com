I"û<p>One of the most dreaded things that you can see while trying to run
some application or trying to install an rpm package is a message
saying that some required library is missing.</p>

<p>Generally this is not a big problem, because most often the library
that you miss is packaged in a package named similarly to the
library. Sometime however this is not the caseâ€¦ Suppose for example
that youâ€™re trying to install IBM JDK 5.0 on a Fedora 11 box. Youâ€™ll
most likely get the following error message:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>error: Failed dependencies:
libstdc++.so.5 is needed by ibm-java2-i386-sdk-5.0-9.0.i386
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and there is no package named libstdc++ that you can install, so how
can you find out which package do you need?</p>

<p>The answer is simple:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>yum provides libstdc++.so.5

Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, presto, refresh-packagekit
compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-66.i586 : Compatibility standard C++ libraries
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Other       : libstdc++.so.5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty neat, eh?</p>
