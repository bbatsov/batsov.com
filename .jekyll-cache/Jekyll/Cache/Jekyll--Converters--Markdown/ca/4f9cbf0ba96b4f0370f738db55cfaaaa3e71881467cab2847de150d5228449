I"r<p>That’s going to be one really short post.  I just wanted to share with
you that I’ve been using <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a> (a new e-mail service
from Basecamp) for the past few months and overall I’m quite happy
with it. This article is not a review of HEY, it’s more an
announcement that now you can reach me at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myfirstname@hey.com</code> if you’re into
e-mail.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>I hope it’s clear that you have to replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myfirstname</code> with my real first name. :D <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
