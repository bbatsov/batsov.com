I"þ<p>Thatâ€™s going to be one really short post.  I just wanted to share with
you that Iâ€™ve been using <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a> (a new e-mail service
from Basecamp) for the past few months and overall Iâ€™m quite happy
with it. This article is not a review of HEY, itâ€™s more an
announcement that now you can reach me at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myfirstname@hey.com</code> if youâ€™re into
e-mail.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Iâ€™ll keep my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@batsov.com</code> e-mail backed by GMail for the time being,
as I didnâ€™t really have any fundamental issues with GMail, other than
my dislike for Googleâ€™s (mis)handling of private data. That being
said, I want to expand my usage of HEY going forward. Iâ€™ve already
moved there all my newsletter subscriptions, as HEY has great support
for newsletter, and Iâ€™ve also been trying to have most of my conversations
with people over HEY as well. To help with this Iâ€™ve updated most public
mentions of my e-mail (e.g. on GitHub) to point to the new HEY-powered address.</p>

<p>HEY is definitely not perfect (e.g. the message editor feels inferior to what you get in GMail, and the same goes for
search functionality), but I love the philosophy of the service and Iâ€™m always open to trying new ideas and workflows.
I hope that down the road Iâ€™ll manage to break free from the grip of Google and leave GMail for good,
but that mostly depends on how HEY will evolve and how well will I adapt to using it.
In the mean time - Iâ€™m looking forward to chatting with more of you over HEY!</p>
