I"ù<p>Every professional developer knows how important to the development
process the keyboard is, so it is only natural to be on the look for
some quality piece of hardware. After a long research in the area of
good keyboards I decided to upgrade my current rig to the recently
released <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Das_Keyboard_III#:~:text=The%20Das%20Keyboard%20III%20was,are%20plate%2Dmounted%20Cherry%20MX.">Das Keyboard 3</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/0/0e/Das_keyboard_3_model_s_ultimate_iso_topview.jpg" alt="Das Keyboard 3" /></p>

<p>Das Keyboard comes in three flavours - Professional (mechanical
keyboard with labelled keys), Ultimate (the original mechanical
keyboard with blank keys) and Silent (mechanical keyboard with labelled
keys that doesnâ€™t produce the trademarked clicking sound of the
original Das Keyboard).<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I bought the Ultimate model, of course. Iâ€™ve been a touch typist for
several years now and I didnâ€™t really cared about the labelled
keys (though I did miss them in games). Two words describe this
keyboard perfectly - <strong>bad ass</strong>. Itâ€™s without a doubt the single
finest piece of keyboard hardware that Iâ€™ve touched, itâ€™s very
comfortable, very solid and I feel that Iâ€™ve actually improved my
typing speed with it. My colleagues donâ€™t like the noisy work of the
keyboard very much, but I have no problems with it. I actually have
grown quite fond of it.</p>

<p>The keyboard also features a two port USB hub, that I didnâ€™t really
consider when I was buying it, but it turned out quite helpful. Iâ€™ve
actually stopped using the USB ports of my computer entirely (except
for input devices) - I use the keyboard hub to plug-in flash drives
and charge devices. When your computer is sitting beneath a desk you
learn to appreciate USB hubs very quickly.</p>

<p>I have long heard stories about Das Keyboardâ€™s quality
and comfort and I it has totally lived up to its hype. They price is
admittedly a bit steep (I bought two keyboards (for home and for work),
each costing $130), but this is our hands and productivity weâ€™re
talking about so we shouldnâ€™t be cheap. So what are
waiting for - research the market yourselves and make your pick! Your
hands deserve a quality keyboard (the Das Keyboard)!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Down the road Iâ€™ve switched to Das Keyboard 4, KUL ES-87 and
eventually to the <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C">Leopold
FC660C</a>. As of 2020 I still believe
that the Leopold is the best keyboard Iâ€™ve ever experienced and Iâ€™d recommend
it to everyone looking for the ultimate typing experience!</p>
