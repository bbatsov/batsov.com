I"Ô<p>Iâ€™d like to apologize to everyone insulted by my previous
posts. Contrary to popular belief I acknowledge EmacsWikiâ€™s
contribution to the Emacs community. Obviously many people are too
fond of its current format so I doubt that it will ever change
(considerably). I didnâ€™t mean to insult anyone, I just wanted to catch
your attention (which unfortunately requires harsher words from time to
time) and point it in the direction of the existing problems.</p>

<p>For the people that werenâ€™t happy with EmacsWiki - the ones that felt
my pain and were looking for a change I present
<a href="http://wikemacs.org">WikEmacs</a> (pronounced wikimacs). Itâ€™s a
MediaWiki powered Emacs wiki, that will try to bring to the community
cleaner, leaner and more up-to-date documentation.</p>

<p>There are only a few guidelines for the contributors there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>articles should be geared only towards the current and future
versions of Emacs (currently 23 and 24) for maintainabilityâ€™s sake.</li>
  <li>articles should not copy Emacsâ€™s or extensionâ€™s official
documentation - they should refer to it instead. An overview, some
nice pointers, tips and links - that seems like a good article,
doesnâ€™t it?</li>
  <li>comments and questions should go to an articleâ€™s discussion page</li>
</ul>

<p>File uploads are disabled on WikEmacs (but image file uploads will
probably be allowed soon) - it will never host Emacs extensions of any
sort.</p>

<p>There is a Google discussion group
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/wikemacs">here</a>
for more general questions regarding the wiki.</p>

<p>Our goal is not to copy over the 8500 articles available at
EmacsWiki. Itâ€™s to provide a good road map for new users coming to
Emacs and enough helpful hints and tips for experienced users. Everyone
is welcome to join our efforts.</p>

<p>As far as short term goals go - have a look at the outlined structure
of the wiki (on its home page), pick a section that interests you and
create/extend/improve it. Our content is licensed with GNUâ€™s Free
Documentation License (which is compatible with Wikipediaâ€™s and
probably EmacsWikiâ€™s GPL2). Some nice blog articles about Emacs might
be converted to wiki articles with permission from their authors. You
might find <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try">pandoc</a> useful to
automatically convert articles from other formats to MediaWiki markup
and <a href="https://launchpad.net/mediawiki-el">mediawiki.el</a> to edit
articles on wiki from the comfort of your beloved editor.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people that brought us the original EmacsWiki. Thanks to
everyone who supported the idea for the new wiki. Thanks in advance to
all future contributors.</p>

<p>Some people will undoubtedly see the birth of WikEmacs as a separatist move to fraction
the Emacs community. To them Iâ€™d like to say that few things in life
are as productive as competition. Obviously a lot of people willing to
contribute to a new wiki are unwilling to do so for EmacsWiki and vice
versa. This is not a contest and there will be no winner. I wish the
best of luck to EmacsWiki and its supporters. What I wish for is to give
our community the best source of documentation available and the
option to choose.</p>
