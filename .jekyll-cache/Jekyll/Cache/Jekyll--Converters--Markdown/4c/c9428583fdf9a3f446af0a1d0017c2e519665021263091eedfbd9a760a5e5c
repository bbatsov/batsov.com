<!--more-->

<p>A lot of time has passed since the previous stable release, for which
Iâ€™m truly sorry.  I kept delaying and delaying the release for various
reasons, but itâ€™s finally here and itâ€™s pretty <strong>big</strong>.  Please,
consult the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>
for some of the more interesting changes. Note that some changes and
new features are totally undocumented, as I havenâ€™t been as demanding
to contributors as Iâ€™m usually on my other projects (meaning I didnâ€™t
ask everyone to update the changelog or the readme).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s funny how open-source works - I never expected that Projectile
would have any users except me, but today itâ€™s one of the most popular
3rd party Emacs extensions. Unfortunately Iâ€™m involved with many
other projects and have a pretty demanding day job, so issues and feature
requests have been piling up
lately. <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues">80 open issues</a> -
thatâ€™s depressing! I guess Iâ€™m a pretty lame maintainer!</p>

<p>If you like the project, Iâ€™d appreciate your assistance to bring their
number down.  Many of the requests are relatively easy to implement,
some donâ€™t make sense and should be simply closed (or might have been
fixed accidentally). Same goes for the open PRs.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all for me now, folks! Iâ€™ll try to deliver stable releases
faster in the future, but I wonâ€™t make any promises. Thanks for all
your help and support! I really appreciate them!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Iâ€™d love for Projectile to have a cool logo. Maybe someone can
help out with that as well?</p>
