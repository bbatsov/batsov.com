I"K<p>I’ve been a GNU/Linux user for quite some time now and a Fedora user
for just as long. The first distribution that I ever used was Fedora 2
and even though I’ve used extensively other distros I’ve always come
back to Fedora. Recently Fedora 15 was released and I was
(naturally) one of the first people to install it.</p>
