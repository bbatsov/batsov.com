I".<p>I’m mostly a Ruby on Rails developer these days and as such I’m pretty
fond of the <a href="http://slim-lang.com">Slim template language</a>. I’ve
always hated HTML + ERB, since that evil duo encourages all sorts of
ever practices and recently I’ve adopted Slim as a replacement for
my long time favourite ERB alternative - <a href="http://haml-lang.com">Haml</a>.</p>

<p>I won’t discuss here the shortcomings of Haml vs Slim, but I’ll share
with you the big advantage Haml has over Slim (for Emacs users at
least) - it has a pretty nice major editing mode for Emacs. Slim’s
Emacs support on the other hand is rather iffy and is presently mostly
based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">haml-mode</code>. That will hopefully change soon, since recently
I’ve become a co-maintainer of
<a href="http://github.com/minad/emacs-slim">slim-mode</a> and I plan to improve
it as much as I can (currently I’m mostly working on precise
font-locking). Any help from interested parties is, naturally, most
welcome. I very much doubt that me and
<a href="https://github.com/minad">Daniel Mendler</a> are the only two people
dreaming of great Slim experience in Emacs.</p>

<p>Let us together eliminate that big Haml advantage.</p>
