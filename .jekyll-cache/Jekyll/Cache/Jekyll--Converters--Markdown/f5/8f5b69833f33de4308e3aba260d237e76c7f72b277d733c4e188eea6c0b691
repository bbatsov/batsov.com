I"ã<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to switch my work environment theme to
something with lower contrast (namely the excellent <a href="https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn">Zenburn
theme</a>). Swing applications,
however,have difficulties with GTK themes when they are using the GTK+
look &amp; feel, so Iâ€™ve decided to go to Nimbus â€“ the new default look &amp;
feel for Java apps since Java 6 Update 10.</p>

<p>The only problem with the plan was that there is no way to change the
look and feel inside NetBeans â€“ it had to be done by changing its
configuration. This is done fairly easy. Just find the file
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/netbeans.conf</code> in NetBeansâ€™s installation folder and append this to
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netbeans_default_options</code> section:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--laf Nimbus</code></p>

<p>Now you just have to (re)start NetBeans and you can enjoy Nimbus.</p>
