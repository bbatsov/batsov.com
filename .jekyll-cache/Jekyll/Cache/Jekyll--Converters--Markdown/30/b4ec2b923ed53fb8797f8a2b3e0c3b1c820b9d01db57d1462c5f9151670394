<p>Hereâ€™s an
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#when-instead-of-single-branch-if">example</a>.
Now you can easily refer to rules in heated style debates with your
friends and co-workers.</p>

<p>This is an addition that was way overdue (for which I take all the

found the time I never did and got the job done (in style).</p>
