I"Ý<p>Some times youâ€™d want to quickly repeat an Emacs command several times and
most of the time it wonâ€™t have a convenient keybinding you can use to
do this. Enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-x z</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repeat</code>) - it simply repeats the most
recently executed command. And the best part? After youâ€™ve pressed
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-x z</code> once you can continue repeating the last command simply by
pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code>. Vi(m) users will probably note that this is quite similar
to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> command there.</p>
