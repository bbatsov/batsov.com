<a href="/articles/2012/03/20/die-emacswiki/">amid a lot of turmoil</a>
I’ve started
<a href="/articles/2012/03/26/wikemacs-the-other-emacs-wiki/">an alternative to EmacsWiki</a>. The
project took off to a great start, but quickly lost traction and now
it’s time to face the truth - I had an assumption, it turned out it(I)
was wrong and I should come to terms with that.</p>

<p>It’s more than apparent at this point that the majority of the Emacs
community is happy with EmacsWiki and that’s fine by me. I’ll be
closing down WikEmacs after 2-3 months and I suggest that everyone who’s
contributed significant chunks of content to it migrate them to
EmacsWiki (I’ll personally move everything good I find). I don’t want
the work people have done to just disappear.</p>

<p>Given the small interest in WikEmacs I doubt that many will miss it. I
thank all the contributors and the supporters of the idea. In the long
term it would be better for us to have a single repository of Emacs
knowledge, that’s why I decided to terminate WikEmacs sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>I want to extend a big public apology to Alex Schroeder for my harsh
criticism of EmacsWiki.  One year later I see that stewarding
documentation projects and nurturing a healthy community around them
is much harder than writing software. I’m but a humble software
engineer and you’ll have to forgive me for my misguided actions.</p>

<p>I hope that something good has(will) come up from all this drama. At
the very least I urge everyone who cares for EmacsWiki to try and
clean up, extend and improve at least a couple of articles on subjects
that are of importance to him. I know that’s something I’ll be doing
from now on.</p>

<p>See you on EmacsWiki!</p>

<p>WikEmacs is dead! Long live the one true EmacsWiki!</p>
