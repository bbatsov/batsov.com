I"P<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode">clojure-mode</a> 3.0 is out!</p>

<p>It’s one of the most ambitious releases in recent times and brings
much improved font-locking across the board.  Other notable changes
include dropping support for Emacs 23 (CIDER doesn’t support it
either) and removing some deprecated features (most notably the
functionality for switching between code and its test; see
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> for an awesome
replacement of the old feature).</p>

<p>An extensive list of the changes is available <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>This version also marks the introduction of an automated test suite
(currently it consists mostly of font-lock tests), which should make
it easier to do changes in the future.</p>

<p>Next step - indentation improvements and decoupling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code>
from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lisp-mode</code>.  Both tasks are related. We’ve been deriving much
from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lisp-mode</code> since day 1 and this has worked reasonably well so
far, but the truth is that Clojure is not Common Lisp (or Emacs Lisp
for that matter) and would benefit from a more refined syntax table,
indentation rules, etc.</p>

<p>When will this happen?
Sadly, I have no idea… Help is definitely welcome!</p>

<p>That’s all for now, folks! Enjoy the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code>!</p>
