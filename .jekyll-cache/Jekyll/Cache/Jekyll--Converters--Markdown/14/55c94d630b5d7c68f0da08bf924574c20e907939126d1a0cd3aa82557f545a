I"~<p>When I program in Java I usually leave the comfort of Emacs and use
IntelliJ IDEA instead (for various reasons that are irrelevant to this
post). IDEA has one particularly nice feature - “auto-save on focus
lost”. Basically you never have to hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-s</code> there explicitly, because
any time your current editor window loses focus its contents get
flushed to the disk automatically. Implementing something exactly the
same in Emacs is impossible (at least in Emacs Lisp), but we can
create a solution that is similar in spirit at least - we can
auto-save buffers when we switch the Emacs window or the current
buffer (which are more or less the most popular ways to change editing
focus in Emacs). This is easy to achieve in Emacs Lisp:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; use shift + arrow keys to switch between visible buffers</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="ss">'windmove</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">windmove-default-keybindings</span> <span class="ss">'super</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;; automatically save buffers associated with files on buffer switch</span>
<span class="c1">;; and on windows switch</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defadvice</span> <span class="nv">switch-to-buffer</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">before</span> <span class="nv">save-buffer-now</span> <span class="nv">activate</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="nv">buffer-file-name</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">save-buffer</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defadvice</span> <span class="nv">other-window</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">before</span> <span class="nv">other-window-now</span> <span class="nv">activate</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="nv">buffer-file-name</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">save-buffer</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defadvice</span> <span class="nv">windmove-up</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">before</span> <span class="nv">other-window-now</span> <span class="nv">activate</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="nv">buffer-file-name</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">save-buffer</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defadvice</span> <span class="nv">windmove-down</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">before</span> <span class="nv">other-window-now</span> <span class="nv">activate</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="nv">buffer-file-name</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">save-buffer</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defadvice</span> <span class="nv">windmove-left</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">before</span> <span class="nv">other-window-now</span> <span class="nv">activate</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="nv">buffer-file-name</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">save-buffer</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defadvice</span> <span class="nv">windmove-right</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">before</span> <span class="nv">other-window-now</span> <span class="nv">activate</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="nv">buffer-file-name</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">save-buffer</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously this code could have been written in a more compact manner
with the use of a macro, but I’ve decided to use this more verbose
variant for the sake of simplicity. We assume that you want to
auto-save your current work (buffer) when you switch to a new buffer
or to a new window (with either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-x o</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">other-window</code>) or a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windmove</code> command).</p>

<p>XEmacs has a hook called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deselect-frame-hook</code> that can take the
concept even further, but it’s absent from GNU Emacs.</p>

<p>So, that’s all for this tip, folks! I hope you’ve enjoyed it!
Personally I find it much more useful that the standard auto-save
mechanism in Emacs. And one more thing -
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> naturally
enables this functionality by default.</p>
