I"6<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a> 0.9 (a.k.a. “EuroCIDER”) is
finally out and it’s our best release yet! (shocker, right?) It took a lot
more time than I originally anticipated, but at least we managed to ship in time
for <a href="http://euroclojure.org">EuroClojure</a>!</p>
