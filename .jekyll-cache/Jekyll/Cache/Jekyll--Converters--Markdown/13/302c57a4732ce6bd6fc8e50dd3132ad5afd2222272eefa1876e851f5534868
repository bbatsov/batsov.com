I"D<p>I’m happy to report that now you can use permalinks to the rules listed in the
community <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rails-style-guide">Rails</a> style guides.</p>

<p>Here’s an
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide#indent-when-to-case">example</a>.
Now you can easily refer to rules in heated style debates with your
friends and co-workers.</p>

<p>This is an addition that was way overdue (for which I take all the
blame). I’d like to say a big <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">THANKS!!!</code> to <a href="https://github.com/todb">Tod Beardsley</a> who
found the time I never did and got the job done (in style).</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Hopefully soon the permalinks will be leveraged by RuboCop.</p>
