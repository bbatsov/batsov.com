I"<p>There are quite a few packages in the “official”
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs">clojure-emacs GitHub organization</a>,
but many of them have been deprecated recently with the release of
CIDER 0.7. Unfortunately not everyone is aware of this yet and I often see
tickets related to those deprecated projects. In this short post I’ll
outline the deprecations and provide a bit of background for them.</p>

<h3 id="clojure-test-mode">clojure-test-mode</h3>

<p>The venerable
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode">clojure-test-mode</a> was
deprecated in favor of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cider-test</code> (which is bundled with CIDER 0.7).
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-test-mode</code> featured quite a lot of inlined Clojure code,
which made the package very hard to maintain and reworking it to use
nREPL middleware was a no-brainer for us. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-test-mode</code> will be
removed from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code> repo at some point. It also interferes
with CIDER’s initialization, so you’re <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to get rid of it.</p>

<p>Down the road we might extend <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cider-test</code> to support other test frameworks
as well (which should be feasible with different middleware providing the same interface).</p>

<h3 id="company-cider">company-cider</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/company-cider">company-cider</a> was deprecated, because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">company-mode</code>
integration was added to CIDER itself (making <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">company-mode</code> the officially supported and recommended
completion library).</p>

<h3 id="ac-nrepl">ac-nrepl</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/ac-nrepl">ac-nrepl</a> has been
superseded by <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/ac-cider">ac-cider</a>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ac-cider</code> has a simpler codebase and leverages the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compliment</code>-based completion
introduced in CIDER 0.7. We’ll probably remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ac-nrepl</code> at some point in the future
to avoid the confusion between the two.</p>

<h3 id="cider-inspect">cider-inspect</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-inspect">cider-inspect</a> was absorbed into CIDER 0.7.</p>

<h3 id="cider-tracing">cider-tracing</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-tracing">cider-tracing</a> was superseded by middleware-based
tracing support integrated in CIDER 0.7.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Those deprecations are also mentioned in the documentation of the
respective packages, but I feel it’s nice to have them listed together
in a single document. Most of the packages will also emit load-time
deprecation warnings.</p>
