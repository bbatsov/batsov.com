I"!<p>When you have applications, whose configuration is as complex as that
of Emacs it’s always a good idea to store that configuration under
version control so you can easily share it between multiple
computers. You can always set up some version control system yourself,
but it’s a lot more convenient (and much more reliable) to use an
already existing code hosting solution such a GitHub.</p>

<p>I have created a <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d">small repo</a>
there housing my humble Emacs configuration (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.emacs</code>, some custom stuff)
and this way I can easily access it on all the computers that I happen
to be working on.</p>

<p>I hope that you’ll find some useful bits in it for your own configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>At some point my custom configuration grew into what is known today as
the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a>. I still maintain
an independent personal setup, that’s very minimalistic in its nature.</p>
