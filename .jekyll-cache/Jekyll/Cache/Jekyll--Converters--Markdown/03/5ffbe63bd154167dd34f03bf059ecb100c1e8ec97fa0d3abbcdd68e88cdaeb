I"6<p>During the past few months I’ve been working on a project to convert
my vast Emacs configuration into something generally useful and
self-contained that could help the typical software engineer. Thus the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-dev-kit">Emacs Dev Kit</a> was
born. Conceptually it’s similar to the older
<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>
and it even shares a bit of code with it. The Emacs Dev Kit, however,
targets more programming languages and features more
customizations/enhancements.</p>
