I";<p>This site was my first attempt to write. I failed miserably and I produced some pretty
crappy content, but I also learned a lot in the process.</p>

<p>Over the course of a decade the blog saw quite a few transformations and shifts in my focus and interests.
For a few years it was named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DevCraft</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and it was hosted on wordpress.com. Afterwards
I adopted the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(think)</code> title and switched to Jekyll, Octopress and then again to Jekyll.
Originally I was writing mostly tutorials on topics like Linux, Java, Emacs and Ruby, but eventually I started writing some essays
as well (my favorite type of posts). As my OSS portfolio grew it started to gain
significant coverage in my blog as well. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(think)</code> was a bit messy and without a clear
direction, but I guess it was a somewhat accurate reflection of myself as well.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve thought at times about deleting some of my lame articles and heavily copy-editing
the rest to make them fit my current beliefs and standards of quality, but this approach
felt like cheating to me. I was who I was and I wrote what I wrote. To me that certainly
has a lot of value. Iâ€™ve been thinking lately that being (very) critical of your old work
is a good indicator that youâ€™re moving in the right direction. We can always do better,
but we need to reach a certain level of experience to see that.</p>

<p>For various reasons (mostly a combination of frustration with Octopress and my (immense) laziness), I didnâ€™t write
anything between 2015 and 2018 and when I finally mustered the will to return to writing
I decided to go with a clean slate and a new blog.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>These days most of my writing happens at <a href="https://metaredux.com">Meta Redux</a>, but
I still plan to post here things that are worth sharing, but donâ€™t fit the overall
idea of Meta Redux (where my primary focus is my OSS work and essay-like articles).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I guess Iâ€™ll still be writing here on programming-related topics, but who knowsâ€¦
Knowing me thereâ€™s a high chance I wonâ€™t actually write anything at all! Thereâ€™s
a good chance this will be final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(think)</code> article.</p>

<p>At any rate - itâ€™s still a lot of fun to be re-reading my old articles (especially the rants)
and comparing the person I used to be with the person I am today.
Iâ€™m starting to think thatâ€™s the biggest value of running a personal blog - itâ€™s
a written account of our evolution as human beings.</p>
