I"Å<p>For many years I‚Äôve enjoyed listening to programming podcasts - it‚Äôs
the perfect way to make a commute a bit more fun and
educational.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">RubyRogues</a> was always
one of my favourite Ruby shows and I find it very amusing that
recently I ended up being their guest. I certainly didn‚Äôt see this coming!
Seems that a lot has changed since the days I followed it actively, but it
was still fun to make an appearance there.</p>
