I"<p>From time to time we need to rename a bunch of files according to some
pattern.  One simple example that comes to mind is that recently I
noticed that some articles in my blog had a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> extension and some
had a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.markdown</code> extension. I don’t like inconsistencies, so I wanted
them all to have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> extension. Bellow I’ll cover several ways to
do this on Linux<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. All the examples will assume you’re renaming
files in the same folder, but it’s typically trivial to extend them to
a directory tree by combining a command with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find -exec</code> or extended
globbing (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**/*.markdown</code>). So, here we go.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Most of those suggestions should also work on other Unix-like operating systems like macOS, *BSD, etc. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
