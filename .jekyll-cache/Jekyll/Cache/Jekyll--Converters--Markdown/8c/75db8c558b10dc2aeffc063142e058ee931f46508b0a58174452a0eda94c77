I"Š<p>2013 was a good year for me in many aspects. Iâ€™ll share here some of
the programming-related achievements of mine over the year that made
me somewhat proud of myself.</p>

<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>

<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>

<h4 id="rubocop">RuboCop</h4>

<p>Iâ€™ve made great headway with the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> static code analyzer
over the year. Working on a big non-Rails Ruby project reminded me
why I fell in love with Ruby in the first place. I was also amazed by
great community that quickly formed around RuboCop and propelled it to
popularity. I hope that in 2014 Iâ€™ll be able to deliver a 1.0 release.</p>

<h4 id="blogging">Blogging</h4>

<p>I finally did some Ruby-related blogging this year - mostly regarding
good programming style. I enjoyed it, although I noticed itâ€™s much
harder for me to blog, than it is to code. Good thing I became a
programmer and not a writer I guess!</p>

<h3 id="emacs">Emacs</h3>

<p>I spent a lot of time working on Emacs-related stuff over the year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started a new Emacs blog called <a href="http://emacsredux.com">Emacs Redux</a></li>
  <li>I improved a lot <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a></li>
  <li>I contributed code to Emacs for the first time</li>
  <li>I took over the maintenance of <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a></li>
  <li>I was involved in a lesser role in the development of many cool Emacs extensions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clojure">Clojure</h3>

<p>I wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide">Clojure Style Guide</a>
at the beginning of the year. I also hoped Iâ€™d be able to work on
static code analyzer for Clojure similar to RuboCop, but I got
sidetracked and this did not happen. I did lots of CIDER-related work
over the year and I hope Iâ€™ll be able improve CIDER significantly in
2014 (I have so many great ideas about it!).</p>

<p>Clojure is still my favorite programming language and hope in 2014 Iâ€™ll be
able to work on more Clojure projects.</p>

<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>

<p>I spent some time playing with algorithms and math for the first time
in a long while (inspired by Coursera).  This was lots of fun! I hope
that in 2014 Iâ€™ll be able to allocate even more time to studying them
properly.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>In previous years I generally spent a lot of time studying/researching new
programming related stuff - new languages, new frameworks, new tools,
new paradigms, etc. Conversely, I spent relatively little time hacking
on open-source projects. 2013 was quite different for me - very little
research, lots of open-source hacking. It was pretty tiresome at times, but
also extremely enjoyable and gratifying experience.</p>

<p>No idea how 2014 will turn out, but I hope it will be at least as fun
as 2013 was!</p>
