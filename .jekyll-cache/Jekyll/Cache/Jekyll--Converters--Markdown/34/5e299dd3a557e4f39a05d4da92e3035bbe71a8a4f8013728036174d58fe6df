I"<p>A few weeks ago I wrote an <a href="/articles/2012/02/19/package-management-in-emacs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">article about the state of package
management in Emacs</a>.
In that article I pointed out that on the side of
<a href="http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el">package.el</a> too much was riding
on the poorly maintained Marmalade repo. Today Marmalade went dark
(again) and many people are wondering what to do now. The answer is
simple - start using <a href="http://melpa.org/">MELPA</a> instead.</p>
