I"ß<p>There are quite a few packages in the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs">clojure-emacs GitHub organization</a>,
but many of them have been deprecated recently with the release of
CIDER 0.7. Unfortunately not everyone is aware of this yet and I often see
tickets related to those deprecated projects. In this short post I‚Äôll
outline the deprecations and provide a bit of background for them.</p>
