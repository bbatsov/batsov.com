I"Ò<p>Iâ€™d like to apologize to everyone insulted by my previous
posts. Contrary to popular belief I acknowledge EmacsWikiâ€™s
contribution to the Emacs community. Obviously many people are too
fond of its current format so I doubt that it will ever change
(considerably). I didnâ€™t mean to insult anyone, I just wanted to catch
your attention (which unfortunately requires harsher words from time to
time) and point it in the direction of the existing problems.</p>
