I"ê<p>I‚Äôve been a GNU/Linux user for quite some time now and a Fedora user
for just as long. The first distribution that I ever used was Fedora 2
and even though I‚Äôve used extensively other distros I‚Äôve always come
back to Fedora. Recently Fedora 15 was released and I was
(naturally) one of the first people to install it.</p>

<p>Everything is great in the new release (as ever), but my Xerox Phaser
3117 printer is unsupported (also as ever) out of the box, so it‚Äôs
time for one of those quick articles on how to get it up and running this
time. First run the following command as root (or with sudo):</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># yum install gutenprint-foomatic</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you can run the ‚ÄúPrinting‚Äù application. It will autodetect your
printer and suggest you to use the driver for Xerox Phaser 3110. Just
accept this suggestion and you should be good to go. Happy printing!</p>
