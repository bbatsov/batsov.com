I"s<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> 0.10.0 is out!</p>

<p>This might come as a surprise for people tracking Projectile’s
development, since recent snapshots were using 1.0 as the version
number, so allow me to explain. I’ve been wanting to release
Projectile 1.0 for a while now, but I felt that without the addition
of <em>per-project settings</em> support and some refinements to the way
<em>ignoring of files &amp; folders</em> currently work, such moniker would be
unjustified. Unfortunately, lately I’ve been quite busy working on
other projects like <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">cider</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> and I don’t have
that much time to work on Projectile, so I kept delaying the 1.0
version.</p>

<p>Recently I decided to release version 0.10 instead, for the benefit of
users of package repos like Marmalade. The minor bump in the version
doesn’t mean that 0.10 is not a noteworthy update, though. 5 months of
development and more than a hundred commits from almost a dozen of
developers have really improved the Projectile experience.  It’s
easily the biggest update of Projectile, since the project was
conceived.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.projectile</code> is always taken into account (previously it was consulted only when doing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">native</code> indexing)</li>
  <li>There’s now the ability to search for files in a specific directory</li>
  <li>More project types are recognized</li>
  <li>You can search for etags (ctags) in a project</li>
  <li><strong>The Commander</strong> (a really cool feature inspired from CIDER &amp; SLIME, that I’ll show in a bit)</li>
  <li>Dozens of (mostly undocumented in the Changelog) bugfixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for more details.</p>

<p>And here’s the new <strong>Commander</strong> in action:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/projectile-commander.gif" alt="Projectile Commander" /></p>

<p>Basically it gives you a way to invoke many of the Projectile commands
with a single key - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find-file</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switch-project</code>,
etc. It’s very handy when switching projects since with this command
you can always pick a different command to execute in the new
project. By the way, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projectile-switch-project</code> will now run the
commander, when invoked with a prefix argument (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-u C-c p s</code>).</p>
