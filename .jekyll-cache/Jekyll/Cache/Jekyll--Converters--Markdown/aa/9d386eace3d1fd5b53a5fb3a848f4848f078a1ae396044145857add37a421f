<p><img src="/assets/images/bozhidar_presenting1.jpg" alt="Bozhidar" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôm Bozhidar<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and I love computers in general and programming in
particular<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on GitHub, contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.</p>

<p>The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
<a href="/presentations/">conference talks</a>. I love speaking at conferences
and I‚Äôm really bad at it!<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="about-think">About (think)</h2>

<p>This site was my first attempt to write. I failed miserably and I produced some pretty
crappy content, but I also learned a lot in the process.</p>

<p>These days most of my writing happens at <a href="https://metaredux.com">Meta Redux</a>, but
I still plan to post here things that are worth sharing, but don‚Äôt fit the overall
idea of Meta Redux.</p>

<p>I guess I‚Äôll mostly be writing on programming-related topics, but who knows‚Ä¶
Knowing me there‚Äôs a high chance I won‚Äôt actually write anything at all!</p>

<h2 id="about-my-other-blogs">About My Other Blogs</h2>

<p>I have a small problem with blogs - I‚Äôve created way too many of them!</p>

<h3 id="emacs-redux">Emacs Redux</h3>

<p>I run a separate blog focused on Emacs, that you might want to check
out as well - <a href="http://emacsredux.com">Emacs Redux</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hey-world">HEY World</h3>

<p>I also have a blog at <a href="https://world.hey.com/bozhidar">HEY World</a>.
I‚Äôm still not sure what I‚Äôll use it for (if anything), but likely it
will host short musings on random non-technical topics.</p>

<p>I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days I‚Äôm a macOS user most of the time.  When I‚Äôm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C">Leopold
FC660C</a><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.  When I‚Äôm on
the road I do (or don‚Äôt do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>
