I"±<p>Iâ€™ve created a new port of the
<a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized color theme</a> for
Emacs 24. While there is
<a href="https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized">another existing port of the theme</a>
Iâ€™ve decided to into a separate direction since Iâ€™ve wanted to keep
the development of Solarized and
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn</a> for Emacs in sync.</p>
