I"¹	<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/powerpack">Powerpack</a> is a small Ruby
library containing (at this point) a few extensions to some core Ruby
classes. I guess that in a way one can say itâ€™s something like Railsâ€™s
ActiveSupport, but with much smaller scope.</p>

<p>Since extending core classes is nasty business great care has been
taken to do so <em>properly</em>. For one - Powerpack would not include its extension
methods if the target class already has method named the same way.</p>

<p>Additionally - youâ€™re able to selectively use the extension methods
that Powerpack provides.You can load the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">powerpack</code> library:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'powerpack'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can load only the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code> extensions:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'powerpack/string'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can load only a specific extension like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String#format</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'powerpack/string/format'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Powerpack was born from my work on the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> static code
analyzer. From time to time I wished I had some of ActiveSupportâ€™s
methods (but was unwilling to use ActiveSupport for various reasons)
or some useful method Iâ€™ve come across in the standard libraries of
other popular languages(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String#format</code> was inspired from Java,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Numeric#pos?</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Numeric#neg?</code> were inspired from Clojure, etc). It
has been helpful to me and I guess it might be helpful to some of you
as well.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to know more, have a look at the
<a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/bbatsov/powerpack/frames">online docs</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts about Powerpack in its current form and
suggestions about its future (more helpful extensions for
instance). Comments, tickets and <a href="http://twitter.com/bbatsov">Twitter</a>
are at your disposal!</p>
