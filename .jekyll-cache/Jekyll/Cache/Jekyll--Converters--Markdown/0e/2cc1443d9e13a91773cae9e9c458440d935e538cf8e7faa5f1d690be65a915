I"<p>Several months passed since I stated my intent
<a href="articles/2013/01/27/the-wikemacs-experiment-is-over-long-live-emacswiki/">to shutdown WikEmacs</a>. While
I still consider the project a failed experiment and stand by
everything I wrote in that post, I have received since lots of messages from
people who were sad to see WikEmacs go. One person in particular,
<a href="https://twitter.com/holocronweaver">Jesse Johnson</a>, was committed to
seeing the project move forward and offered to take over its stewardship.</p>
