I"û<p>Iâ€™ve created a new port of the
<a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized color theme</a> for
Emacs 24. While there is
<a href="https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized">another existing port of the theme</a>
Iâ€™ve decided to into a separate direction since Iâ€™ve wanted to keep
the development of Solarized and
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn</a> for Emacs in sync.</p>

<p>So without further ado hereâ€™s a screenshot of the theme (or the dark
variant to be precise):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/solarized-emacs.png" alt="Solarized for Emacs" /></p>

<p>Note that this is a very early version and I havenâ€™t fine tuned all
the colors yet. The source code and installation instructions can be
found on <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The theme is already bundled in
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> and Iâ€™ll
submit it to Marmalade soon. Note that Iâ€™ve dropped some things like
the degraded palette and the 16 color palette (at least for now),
since I doubt many people need them. On the other hand - youâ€™ll proper
coloring in most prominent modes out of the box.</p>

<p>Feedback, suggestions and patches are always welcome.</p>
