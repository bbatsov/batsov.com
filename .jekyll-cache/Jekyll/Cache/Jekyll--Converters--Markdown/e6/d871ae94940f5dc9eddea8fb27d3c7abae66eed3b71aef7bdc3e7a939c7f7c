I"j	<p>At <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> I had the chance to shake
Rich Hickey’s hand and exchange a few words with him. When I asked him
whether he currently uses CIDER or Cursive for Clojure development he
replied that he preferred a simpler solution – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code> &amp;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inferior-lisp-mode</code>.</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code>’s
integration with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inferior-lisp-mode</code> sucks (big time). It has always
been extremely limited and was never really improved/extended. It has
no Clojure specific features and no code completion. I felt that Rich
and all the people using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inferior-lisp-mode</code> deserved something better,
so I quickly put together <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure">inf-clojure</a>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inf-clojure</code> provides some Clojure specific features like showing a
var’s doc or source, derives some core functionality from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code>
and even features basic code-completion (and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">company-mode</code>
support). That’s not much admittedly, but it’s a good start. Extending
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inf-clojure</code> is super easy and I expect that we’ll add a bit more
features to it along the way (e.g. macroexpansion).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inf-clojure</code> is available in MELPA and will eventually replace
completely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inferior-lisp-mode</code> when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code> 4.0 is released.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inf-clojure</code> is nothing like CIDER and will never
be. CIDER will always be the powertool for Clojure programming in
Emacs. I do understand, however, that some people are overwhelmed by
CIDER and some people simply don’t need anything sophisticated. I hope
they’ll enjoy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inf-clojure</code>!</p>
