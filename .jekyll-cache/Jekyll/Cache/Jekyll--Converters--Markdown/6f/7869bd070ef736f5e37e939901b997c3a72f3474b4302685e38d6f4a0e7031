I"<p>I’m planning to release the long overdue <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a> 0.8 at <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">clojure/conj</a> 2014.
I’ll be giving a talk there that will be mostly about CIDER, so this seems like a pretty good idea to me.</p>

<p>I’d like to ask you to do a bit of extra testing to the current
snapshot builds, so we can deliver a solid release (if we’re lucky -
the most solid ever). Guess you should pay extra attention to the
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">new features</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to get some issue fixed in time for 0.8 you’d better <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues">get started right away</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
