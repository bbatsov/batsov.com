I"ï<p>Canâ€™t wait for
<a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">Octopress 3.0</a>
to be released! Octopress 2 is killing me and I was seriously
considering going back to a plain Jekyll blog, before I saw 3.0 is right around the corner.</p>

<p>Any day nowâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Never got to upgrade to Octopress 3.0. Eventually (3 years later), <a href="/articles/2011/04/23/moving-to-jekyll/">I went back to Jekyll</a>. If only I had done this earlier!</p>
