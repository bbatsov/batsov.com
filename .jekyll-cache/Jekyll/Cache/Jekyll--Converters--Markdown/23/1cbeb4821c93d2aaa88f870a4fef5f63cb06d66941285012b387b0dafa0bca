I"¿<p>PPAs (Personal Package Archives) are a popular way to install pre-built packages that
for some reason are not (yet) available in Ubuntuâ€™s standard package repositories.
Some common examples that come to my mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installing the newest release of Emacs</li>
  <li>installing the newest GPU drivers</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, if youâ€™re lucky<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> you might not need the packages from the PPA
anymore, so this brings us to the question of todayâ€™s article - how can you
quickly remove everything you installed from a PPA?  If you installed only a
single package thatâ€™s not a big deal, but you might have installed dozens of
packages from one PPA. A good example would be
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers">oibaf/graphics-drivers</a>.
Once you no longer need the newest drivers (e.g. after a distro upgrade) you can
remove all of them like this:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>ppa-purge
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>ppa-purge ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will remove all packages installed from the PPA. Depending on whether the
packages exist in other enabled repos or not that might result in downgrade or
complete removal of those packages. In the specific example Iâ€™ve given weâ€™d just
downgrade all video driver packages to their versions available in Ubuntuâ€™s own
repos.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all I have for you today. Keep hacking!</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Or unlucky - imagine some snapshot versions crashing constantly.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
