I"<p>After a long period of planning I finally migrated my professional CV
from Word to LaTeX last weekend. Since I live in the European Union I
used the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/europecv/">europecv</a> LaTeX class.</p>

<p>I’ve uploaded the LaTeX code into <a href="http://github.com/bbatsov/cv">GitHub</a> feel free to borrow it for
your CVs if you like it. You’ll have to compile the <strong>master.tex</strong> file
with <strong>pdflatex</strong> to get a nicely formatted pdf version of the CV.</p>
