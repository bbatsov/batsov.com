I"»<p><a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/">Zenburn</a> is a popular colour theme for
vim, developed by Jani Nurminen. Itâ€™s my personal
belief (and probably that of many of its users I presume) that itâ€™s one of the
best low contrast themes out there and that Zenburn is exceptionally
easy on the eyes. Btw, I love Zenburn so much that Iâ€™ve even created a
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/blog/blob/master/css/syntax.css">Zenburn theme for Jekyll</a> to be able to use for my blog.</p>

<p>The project was originally
<a href="https://github.com/dbrock/zenburn-el">ported to Emacs</a> by Daniel
Brockman, but it seems that he has lost interest in it recently - very
few updates has been published by him in the past few years. This is
the reason why I gathered all improvements that I could find laying
around the Internet and applied them to the last official Zenburn
version, effectively starting
a <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs/blob/master/zenburn-legacy.el">fork of the project</a>. So far, so goodâ€¦</p>

<p>Danielâ€™s version of Zenburn, however, had reached a state in which it took me
too much to make improvements to it - since a lot of users had direct access
to modify it everything in it was in complete disarray - itâ€™s full of
uses of colours that were not defined by the original zenburn,
questionable coding practices and inconsistent theming of
faces. Yesterday I decided to take a closer look at the code of the
theme and clean it up a little - 20 minutes later I was writing <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs/blob/master/zenburn.el">a new
zenburn theme from scratch</a>. I decided that making everything from
the start will probably be less effort anyways.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve added enough faces in the new theme to make it usable for most
users and Iâ€™ll (hopefully) continue to improve the theme and expand
the supported modes constantly. If youâ€™re interested - give it a try!
If youâ€™re unhappy with something - create an issue in GitHub (or even
better send me a pull request with your suggested improvements).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s my desire to make the new <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn for Emacs</a> just as good as the original.</p>
