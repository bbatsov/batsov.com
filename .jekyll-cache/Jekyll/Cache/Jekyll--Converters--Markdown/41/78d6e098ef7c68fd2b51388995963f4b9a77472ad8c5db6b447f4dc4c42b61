I"è<p>When you have applications, whose configuration is as complex as that
of Emacs it‚Äôs always a good idea to store that configuration under
version control so you can easily share it between multiple
computers. You can always set up some version control system yourself,
but it‚Äôs a lot more convenient (and much more reliable) to use an
already existing code hosting solution such a GitHub.</p>
