Someone complained earlier today that my [Pixel 6A article]({% post_url 2022-12-15-back-to-android-my-take-on-the-pixel-6a %}) was picked up by [Planet Emacslife](https://planet.emacslife.com/). While I wasn't involved in adding my blog there and I never promised to write exclusively about Emacs, this is a good opportunity to remind people my blog has several topic-specific RSS feeds about:

- [Emacs](/feeds/Emacs.xml)
- [Clojure](/feeds/Clojure.xml)
- [Ruby](/feeds/Ruby.xml)
- [OCaml](/feeds/OCaml.xml)
- [Meta](/feels/Meta.xml) (much of my essays and random articles go under this tag)

I even wrote an article a while ago about [how to setup multiple feeds with Jekyll]({% post_url 2021-11-13-atom-feeds-in-jekyll-redux %}).

That's all I have for you today!
