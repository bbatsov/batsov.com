Remember [me trying out Mastodon]({% post_url 2022-12-20-bozhidar-is-on-mastodon %}) a while ago? Well, it didn't stick. For various reasons.

I'm still not happy with the current state of X/Twitter, though, so I kept
looking for other alternatives and lately I've been playing with Bluesky. I like it
for a few reasons:

- I don't have to think which server to use
- I can easily self-verify using some domain that I own
- It looks just like Twitter
- They don't have plans to monetize it with ads (or so they claim)
- It's small enough that bots and trolls still don't care about it
- It's developing quickly - I've noticed lots of improvements over the time I've been using it

Bluesky still misses a lot of features I consider important - from basic stuff
like bookmarks, to more important things like enough (critical mass of) people
using it. Still, it has a nice vibe and I think it has a higher chance to succeed
in the long run, compared to Mastodon.

I serious doubt in will really challenge the leading position of X (or even that
of Threads), but as long as it attracts enough people to be useful that'd be a
big success in my book.

If you're on Bluesky feel free to [ping
me](https://bsky.app/profile/batsov.net).  If you haven't tried it already - it
just went public a few days ago, after requiring invites for sign-up for the past
year. See you around! Blue skies ahead!
