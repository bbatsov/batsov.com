It's the final day of 2021 and tradition dictates that we should reflect on the
year behind us. I like writing such "year in review" articles, because it's so
much fun to read them myself a few years down the road. I guess most of us will
remember this year as the second year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, but it
was a fairly good year for me regardless.[^1]

I won't touch upon my OSS work in this article, as I plan to write a separate one
over at <https://metaredux.com>.

So, let's start with the highlights of 2021.

## Highlights

### Vaccines

This is definitely the most important thing that happened in 2021 from my perspective - now we have an effective way to fight the pandemic, and a path towards our old lives.

I got vaccinated as quickly as possible, which allowed me to lead a semi-normal life afterwards. Now I could spent some time with my friends again and even do a bit of traveling. Sadly, it turned out I live in the [land of the free and the dumb](https://world.hey.com/bozhidar/the-land-of-the-free-and-the-dumb-324c7554)... During the pandemic I learned a lot of things about the people around me, most of them quit disappointing.

Just a couple of days ago I got my booster shot as well. 5G signal operating at max output!

### Travel

This year I finally managed to travel outside Bulgaria. I didn't travel much and I didn't visit any exotic places, but I was extremely happy to be able to visit different countries again. Most of this travel happened during my sabbatical from work in the summer/autumn. Certainly this was my favorite part of the year.

Here's a list of all the places I visited this year:

- Kyiv, Ukraine
- Rybotyn, Ukraine
- Venice, Italy
- Zakynthos, Greece
- Santorini, Greece
- Corfu, Greece
- Athens, Greece
- Marradi, Italy
- Milan, Italy
- Nice, France
- Menton, France
- Antibes, France
- Cannes, France
- Bologna, Italy
- Florence, Italy

I guess I was mostly looking for good beaches and good food this year.

### The Year of the Desktop

This was the first year where I spent more time on a desktop computer
than on a laptop since 2011.[^2] Desktops are great! Especially if you are
spending most of your time at home and you don't have to carry them around.

Here's mine:

| CPU | AMD RYZEN 7 3700X |
| GPU | ASUS DUAL Radeon RX 5500 XT EVO OC 8G |
| Motherboard | AORUS X570 ULTRA |
| SSD | 960GB M.2 2280 Corsair Force Series MP510 |
| RAM | 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz Corsair Vengeance LPX |
| Case | Fractal Design Define 7 |
| PSU | Fractal Design Ion+ 660W Platinum |

It's cheap, powerful, quiet, never overheats, never runs out of juice and it has all the ports in the world. You can even swap parts yourself! As a bonus - it glows in the dark and it looks bad-ass!
I got it in July 2020 and it has been my primary computer ever since. Get this desktop had a few interesting
ramifications:

- It showed me that drivers are still a major problem with Linux
- It led me to rediscover Windows and gaming
- I'm finally using the ethernet at home
- Now that I have more ports to spare I got inspired to buy more peripherals

All in all - this was one of the best things to come out of the pandemic. I can recommend
to everyone to assemble their perfect desktop. It's a lot of fun!

### The Year of Windows

This was also the first year since 2003 that I've spent almost exclusively
on Windows! I've been mostly a Linux (2004-2011) and macOS (2011-2020) user
in recent years.

I'm really impressed by the new direction of Microsoft as a company and the work
they've done to make Windows 10/11 a viable option for software development
(think WSL, Windows Terminal, PowerToys, etc).  I think it's safe to say that at
this point Windows is a better Linux than many standalone Linux distros. The
native Wayland support in Windows 11 is just epic![^3]

Admittedly, I ended up on Windows [quite unexpectedly](https://metaredux.com/posts/2021/07/31/back-to-linux.html), but I've enjoyed the experience so much that
I recently bought a [Windows laptop]({% post_url 2021-12-23-new-laptop-lenovo-yoga-slim-7 %}) as well.

### The Year of StarCraft II

This year I've wasted a lot of my free time playing StarCraft II multiplayer.
I never got particularly good (I guess I'm too old for this), but I still managed
to get to the Golden League with Protoss and I had a lot of fun (and frustration)
in the process.

There are so many strategies and potential counters to them, that
I really think StarCraft II is probably the ultimate RTS strategy. Perhaps we can
even compare it to chess.

### Revival of (think)

This year I've decided to revive my (original) personal site/blog:

* I updated [its visuals]({% post_url 2021-11-01-switching-to-minimal-mistakes %})
* I restructured heavily the auxiliary pages (e.g. [About](/about))
* I wrote 25 articles (my most productive year since 2013)
* I've started doing [link posts]({% post_url 2021-12-09-experimenting-with-link-posts %}).
* I've [killed the comments]({% post_url 2021-11-02-blog-comments-are-dead %}) on the blog.

I've also decided to use "Meta Redux" mostly for my OSS work and use (think)
for pretty much everything else. I played a bit with [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/bozhidar/), but it seems I like Markdown and Emacs way too much.

### Writing

I did a lot of writing on all my blogs last year.
Here are the highlights:

* [A Note about Recruiters]({% post_url 2021-11-03-a-note-about-recruiters %})
* [Your Name is Your Brand]({% post_url 2021-11-14-your-name-is-your-brand %})
* [Why Emacs: Redux]({% post_url 2021-11-16-why-emacs-redux %})
* [Firefox is the Only Alternative]({% post_url 2021-11-29-firefox-is-the-only-alternative %})
* [Back to Linux](https://metaredux.com/posts/2021/07/31/back-to-linux.html)

I wrote only a handful of essays this year, but I wrote a lot of tutorials and
"commentaries". I've become a big fan of the "link post" concept (think "Daring Fireball").

### The Year in Software

This year I made a lot of changes to my basic toolbox - some of them for practical reasons, others for ideological, or some combination of both.

#### Firefox

Firefox is once again my primary web browser. If you value the idea of open standards and online privacy you should consider [making the switch]({% post_url 2021-11-29-firefox-is-the-only-alternative %}) as well.

#### Fastmail

After using Gmail since day 1, this year I decided to [switch to Fastmail](https://metaredux.com/posts/2021/07/31/hasta-la-vista-gmail.html).
6 months later I'm extremely happy with this decision and I only wish I made
it earlier.

#### 1Password

Similarly, after using LastPass for a very long time, this year I got so fed up with it that I finally tested some alternatives and in the end of the day I settled on
1Password.

#### Authy

So many tool changes this year! There are many authenticator apps out there (I've been using mostly Google Authenticator), but definitely Authy is my favorite one so far (mostly for the ability to use it on multiple devices).

I'm still waiting for a better approach to 2FA in general, but for the time being Authy will do.

#### Notion

I've started using Notion for note taking. I'm a huge fan of [Bear](https://bear.app/), but sadly it's available only on iOS and macOS. I tried OneNote before Notion, but I found it too weird. Notion is a lot more than a note-taking tool, and I don't really like this. I prefer simple laser-focused tools (except Emacs!), so I might explore other options down the road.

#### Microsoft ToDo

The artist formerly known as Wunderlist. It was the first todo app I ever used and now I've come full circle. For me it's a partial replacement of the Reminders app in iOS and Trello (which I normally use for Personal Kanban).

I like Microsoft ToDo a lot for a couple of reasons:

* it's free
* it's available on all Platforms
* it's super clean and simple

The total opposite of Notion.

### Books

I didn't read much this year, especially when it comes to fiction. I challenged
myself to read 36 books, [ended up with only 25](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/27460174). I did almost no reading in the final months of the year.

This year I was mostly interested in business books and the stories of famous companies and entrepreneurs. I also revisited "Hyperion", which was just as good as I remembered it to be.

### Movies & TV Shows

This was another year that I spent mostly away from my beloved cinemas.
I think I saw only 3-4 movies on the big screen, most notably "Dune".
I'm pretty sure it was the movie of the year for me, but I'm probably
biased as I'm a huge fan of the books and I've been waiting for a very long
time for a decent "Dune" movie.

I watched several TV shows throughout the year, but nothing really stood out.
Perhaps "Better Call Saul" was the one I enjoyed the most. "The Wheel of Time"
was definitely the biggest disappointment.

I've just started watching the highly acclaimed "Succession" on HBO, and I hope
that it will turn out to be the great show I've been longing for.

### 7 years at Toptal

I've joined Toptal in Jan 2015. Before this my longest tenure in any company
was around 2.5 years.

As it stands today I'm employee #12 in a team of 1000+ people. I definitely didn't expect any of this in 2015! I'm very proud of everything we've achieved at Toptal and I still enjoy working there very much.

### Personal Finance

2021 was the 3rd year since I've started to invest my savings actively (mostly in individual stocks). I've had a good year overall and I've reached my primary objectives on that front.

As I get older I definitely think a lot more
about savings, investments and generating some passive income.
I ignored all the crypto hype for yet another year and I stuck to my guns and
my simple value investing strategy.

Finance is also a fun hobby for me and I dedicate a lot of my free time to it. I'm following a lot of news feeds, blogs, and YouTube channels dedicated to investing. I even subscribed to the Wall Street Journal last year! If I didn't like to analyze companies and industries so much, I'd certainly go for investment in some passive ETFs. That's the way to go for most people.

## Lowlights

No year is complete without its lowlights.

### Conferences

Another year with no conferences in the real world. I participated in a few
online events, but without the interactions with the people around the talks
conferences just don't feel the same to me. It's also kind of hard to organize
proper conference parties online. :-)

I've always said that my favorite track is the "hallway" track.
I miss the vibe of real (classic?) conferences and all the great people I've met at them.

### Sports

Wanted to do more sports, ended up doing none. Story of my life.

### Spanish

Learning (more) Spanish continues to remain a goal for me, but
I've made very little progress on that front. I keep paying for
Babbel, but I rarely find time for it.

This year I've started to wonder if won't be a bad idea to learn a bit
of Italian and French as well.

### Learning

In general I learned very little new things this year. I didn't explore any
new programming languages, libraries, etc.

I blame StarCraft II (and my general laziness) for that.

## Epilogue

So, what's next? I don't have any ambitious plans for 2022. All I wish for is that:

* me and my friends and family stay healthy
* we manage to find a way to end the damn pandemic and return to our normal lives

Pretty tall order, right?

No objectives, no key results.[^4] 2022, here I come!
