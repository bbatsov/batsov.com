Every professional developer knows how important to the development
process the keyboard is, so it is only natural to be on the look for
some quality piece of hardware. After a long research in the area of
good keyboards I decided to upgrade my current rig to the recently
released [Das Keyboard 3](http://www.daskeyboard.com/).

Das Keyboard comes in three flavours - Professional(mechanical
keyboard with labelled keys), Ultimate(the original mechanical
keyboard with blank keys) and Silent(mechanical keyboard with labelled
keys that doesn't produce the trademarked clicking sound of the
original Das Keyboard).

I bought the Ultimate model, of course. I've been a touch typist for
several years now and I didn't really cared about the labelled
keys(though I did miss them in games). Two words describe this
keyboard perfectly - **Bad Ass**. It's without a doubt the single
finest piece of keyboard hardware that I've touched, it's very
comfortable, very solid and I feel that I've actually improved my
typing speed with it. My colleagues don't like the noisy work of the
keyboard very much, but I have no problems with it. I actually have
grown quite fond of it.

The keyboard also features a two port USB hub, that I didn't really
consider when I was buying it, but it turned out quite helpful. I've
actually stopped using the USB ports of my computer entirely(except
for input devices) - I use the keyboard hub to plug-in flash drives
and charge devices. When your computer is sitting beneath a desk you
learn to appreciate USB hubs very quickly.

I have long heard stories about Das Keyboard's quality
and comfort and I it has totally lived up to its hype. They price is
admittedly a bit steep(I bought two keyboards for home and for work
each costing 130$), but this is our hands and productivity we're
talking about so we shouldn't be cheap. So what are
waiting for - research the market yourselves and make your pick, your
hands deserve a quality keyboard(the Das Keyboard)!
