Let's talk a bit about `.net`. No, not Microsoft's .NET, but
the other `.net` - one of the original top-level
internet domains. Given how popular `.com`
has become, I find it really strange that `.net` failed to
reach such prominence. Even `.org` is more popular than `.net`!

That's quite disappointing, as I think that historically `.net` was the best
domain for personal sites, for various reasons:

- `.com` used to stand for "commerce", so it's a bit weird to be using such a
domain for a personal site
- `.org` used to stand for a (non-profit) organization, so it's extra weird to use
such a domain for a personal site
- `.net` stands for "network", which for personal sites I always interpreted as "my place on the (Inter)net"
- a lot of good names are still available for `.net` (compared to `.com` at least), as the domain is not super popular

Of course, today we have a lot more top-level domain options to choose from:

- `.info`, the first additional domain, that never took off
- a ton of country domains that can result is some cool looking domain names (e.g. `sever.us`)
- all the [recent additions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#ICANN-era_generic_top-level_domains) like `.blog`, `.site`, `.name`, etc

Still, I like the appeal of the original domains as they are all:

- cheap (usually around $10/year, while some "modern" domains go as high as $35/year)
- short (I prefer typing `.net` or `.com` compared to `.engineer`)
- widely known and recognized. I don't know about you, but I'm still a bit surprised when I see sites using the newer "more exotic" domain names.

And of the originals, `.net` has the most appeal for me, at least when it comes to personal sites/blogs/etc.

Obviously, this wasn't always the case - after all this site uses the domain `batsov.com`, and I own domains like
`metaredux.com` and `emacsredux.com`. Let's just say that back then I didn't really think about the semantics of domain names that much.
By the way, I do own `batsov.net` as well, and I actually use it for my personal email address.[^1] I would have changed the domain for this site
as well, if it was easier to setup redirects on GitHub Pages. Anyways, that's not a big deal for me.

I guess the original domains have long lost their original semantics. I guess
search engines tilted the scales in favor of `.com` (and `.org` to some extent).
Still, there's always some meaning behind a name and the best names tend to have
a strong bond to that meaning. Naming is hard, but it's also extremely rewarding
once you get it right. I hope I've managed to spark your interest in `.net` and
that over time you'll grow to love and cherish it as I do. `.net` forever!

[^1]: Now the shorthand for my email address is BBN, rather than BBC. That's a big win!
