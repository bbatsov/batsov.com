Long time, no write. It's been quite a while since my last article here.
Such dry spells always make a bit sad, as I love writing and I have a huge
backlog of ideas that I want to expand upon. So, why did this happen?

As you can imagine - there are always multiple reasons. I do think that the main reason
for my diminished presence here is that I turned 40 earlier this month.[^1]
As it usually happens with me around milestones in my life, I've been in a very
self-reflective mood during much of the year. I've been wondering a lot about the life decisions
I've made to date, and what's next for me. I didn't really come up with any revelations, but
I did a lot of thinking regardless.

It's funny how quickly life passes. I feel like I was 20 just a couple of years ago. In a way it seems to me that life moves faster and faster the older you get. I'd like to
believe that I'm still young at heart, but I might just be fooling myself.

I highly doubt anyone wants to read anything about my personal struggles, goals, regrets, etc, so I'll just write a bit about some "professional" milestones that might be more of general interest:

- 20 years in programming, even more if we count the time in high-school, where officially I studied CS, but for me computers were mostly fun. (I was an avid gamer back in the day) That's half my life at this point. 20 years later I love programming a lot more than in the beginning, so it seems to me I chose the right career (hobby as well).
- Almost 20 years of passion for Free and Open-Source software. 15+ years of being very actively engaged in the FOSS community. I've learned so much from the amazing people in the Emacs, Java, Ruby, Clojure, etc communities and I feel very fortunate to be able to contribute something back.
- 19 years have passed since my first attempt to be an educator. I used to do a lot of teaching, but this now feels like something that happened in a different life.
- 13 years working in various managerial roles. 12 of them spent in the so-called "Senior Leadership". I love to think of myself as a programmer first, but this might be just wishful thinking at this point. I never thought that I would become a leader in any shape or form. I'm still surprised that I did!
- Almost 10 years in the same job - essentially my entire 30s. A quarter of my life! That was one wild ride, that I would have never envisioned when it started.
- Almost 20 of years preaching the gospel of the One True Editor! I'm still a true believer!
- So many articles, talks and FOSS projects! Looking back I'm not sure how I found both the time and the energy for everything I've done. The "era" between 27 and 35 was particularly wild. I will always cherish those years and remember them fondly!

While I do have some regrets about some things I've done and I didn't do, looking back I'm quite happy with how my life (and career) turned out. Thanks to everyone who was a part of it, supported me in some shape or form, and made the adventure as fun as it was! A physician recently told me the period between 30 and 40 is the best in life and it all goes downhill from there, but I still hope that the best is yet to come.

That's all I have for you today. Keep hacking!

[^1]: I should have probably written this article on the 13th of October, but I thought that
31st of October is the next best thing.
