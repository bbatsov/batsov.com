When you have applications, whose configuration is as complex as that
of Emacs it’s always a good idea to store that configuration under
version control so you can easily share it between multiple
computers. You can always set up some version control system yourself,
but it’s a lot more convenient (and much more reliable) to use an
already existing code hosting solution such a GitHub.

I have created a [small repo](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d)
there housing my humble Emacs configuration (`.emacs`, some custom stuff)
and this way I can easily access it on all the computers that I happen
to be working on.

I hope that you'll find some useful bits in it for your own configuration.

**Update**

At some point my custom configuration grew into what is known today as
the [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). I still maintain
an independent personal setup, that's very minimalistic in its nature.
