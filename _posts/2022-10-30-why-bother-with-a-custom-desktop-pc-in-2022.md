title: Why Bother with a Custom Desktop PC in 2022?

Many people are quite surprised when I tell them that my primary computer is a
custom-built desktop PC, that I assembled myself. After all, desktops have been
going out of fashion for over a decade and most people these days use laptops or
even tablets as their primary (work) devices. The only big users of the desktop
PCs today seem to be gamers, but they rarely assemble their rigs from
scratch.[^1] I'm definitely not a (big) gamer. Customs-built PCs require some
degree of maintenance (at the very least you have to get them working) and are
prone to some subtle issues (e.g. the RAM not playing well with the MB, some
drivers being a mess, etc). So, why bother with all of this in 2022?

Well, I certainly don't do it for practical reasons. I definitely think that
desktop computers still have a lot of value for many people:

- They force you to work on desk, therefore they have better ergonomics.
- They are usually upgradeable to some extent.
- They never (rarely) overheat.
- They don't run out of battery.
- They are usually more powerful than laptops.
- They usually have better value than laptops. E.g. I built my desktop for almost
half the money I paid for my M2 MacBook Air.

Obviously the desktop computers are not particularly portable, but I've always
favored the combination of a thin and light laptop, that's great for travel, and
a powerful desktop computer for when I'm at the office/home. I despise carrying
around the so called "portable workstations" that are 16 inch and weight
2.5-3kg.

Of course, I could have just gotten some pre-built desktop like the Mac Studio
or a custom pre-built PC. Neither did I need to bother with the assembly. So,
it's still not clear why I decided to go all the way with this.

The answer is rather simple - I'm very quaint (boringly old-fashioned) person
and I'm always curious to understand how everything works. I grew up in the day
and age where it was extremely common to build your own PC and I've always had a
lot of love for tinkering with my hardware and doing small tweaks/upgrades here
and there. For over 15 years I was selecting the parts for the computers of many
friends and family members and I was helping them assemble/upgrade them. Then
suddenly this type of computers grew out of fashion and almost everyone embraced
laptops in the past decade. Computers became disposable commodities that you can
buy from pretty much every electronics store, not to mention numerous online
outlets. People embraced the new way as better - after all it meant less upfront
your for you and less maintenance work down the road. If you can't upgrade
anything than you have nothing to think about, right? Even I fell victim to
modern way of thinking and I spent something like 8 years (between 2012 and
2020) without a custom-built PC. For a few years a had a Mac Mini Server and
afterwards I was using my MacBook Pro as my only computer.[^2]

While this definitely got the job done, I was always missing tending to a
computer a considered truly my own. It felt almost like some romantic notion
with little practical merit. Okay, perhaps the practical merit is that if you
maintain your own PC you're definitely more up-to-date with what's happening in
the hardware world. Not a bad thing in my book, but probably something that's
not important at all to most people.

So, perhaps I bother with custom desktops just because of nostalgia. Perhaps the
tinkerer in me demands in. One thing is certain - that's something that brings
me a lot of joy and that is what matters most in the end of the day. We can't be
practical all the time - that'd be so boring!

I can also draw a few parallels to Emacs - Emacs is all about building your own
editor that's uniquely attuned to you. I usually think of Linux (especially
distros like Gentoo and Arch) the same way - building material for your
operating system. Obviously the way to get a computer that's attuned to you is
to build it yourself. That's certainly not for everyone and that's perfectly
fine. Emacs and Gentoo are not for everyone either.

By the way, I never mentioned what exactly is my rig, so here it is:

| CPU | AMD Ryzen 7 3700X |
| CPU Cooler | Arctic Freezer A35 |
| GPU | ASUS Dual Radeon RX 5500 XT EVO OC 8G |
| Motherboard | AORUS X570 ULTRA |
| SSD | 960GB M.2 2280 Corsair Force Series MP510 |
| RAM | 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz Corsair Vengeance LPX |
| Case | Fractal Design Define 7 |
| PSU | Fractal Design Ion+ 660W Platinum |

Nothing fancy, but exactly what I needed for my use-cases. I got it in July
2020, while I had some extra time to kill during the COVID-19 lockdowns. I paid
for it about 1600 EUR, which seemed like a great value to me given that a decently
spec-ed high-end laptop (e.g. a MacBook Pro) costs closer to 3000 EUR.

I really care about power efficiency and silent operation
and that's reflected in my selection of parts - a 65W CPU, a semi-passively
cooled PSU and GPU, and really silent CPU and case fans. I also really
hate RGBs that lit your rig like a Christmas tree. The minimalist
in me has always disliked everything that's not really needed.

While I had some issues along the way[^3], overall my experience
with the machine has been great and I don't regret any of the time I had to
dedicate to it. If anything - I regret not having done this earlier!
It's holding up remarkably well and I can imagine it going strong for at least
2-3 years more without any significant upgrades. After all I can easily outfit
it with a 16 core Ryzen 5950X and 32GB memory more, which would certainly add a
lot of punch.[^4] That's the beauty of upgradable hardware - it can evolve to suit
your current needs.

Custom-built desktops are not very practical, but they are very cool. They are a reflection of yourself. And they are so much fun to play with!

That's all I have for you today. Keep hacking!

[^1]: And they mostly (only?) care about their GPUs.
[^2]: I did use it docked and with an external display most of the time, though.
[^3]: E.g. the GPU not playing well with Linux and the recent [CPU cooler upgrade drama]({% post_url 2022-10-30-lessons-learned-from-a-hardware-upgrade-gone-wrong %}).
[^4]: Knowing me - by then I'd probably be really eager to try out Meteor Lake and some Intel Arc GPU. As I said before - I'm not very practical when it comes to computers!
