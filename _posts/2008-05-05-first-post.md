Hello, everyone! Welcome to my blog!

I'll post here bits and pieces inspired by my humble experience as a
software developer. Expect to see primarily articles about Lisp,
Emacs, Java and Ruby, but also about software development in general.

As a fan of the Star Wars franchise I often like to quote characters
from the movies. I feel that this is the time for one such quote.

> Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an
> apprentice.
>
> -- Master Yoda

Iâ€™m no hacker wizard by any means, but I hope that I can
help someone learn something useful and maybe I'll manage to learn something
from the readers of my blog (if I have any, that is). In this sense
one can say that in life we're always the master and the apprentice at
the same time...

I hope you'll enjoy reading my blog!
