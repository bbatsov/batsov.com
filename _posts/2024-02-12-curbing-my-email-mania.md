I've [had a problem with email for a while now]({% post_url
2022-05-27-email-mania %}). It took me a while to recognize how absurd this is,
but it finally happened. Using multiple email vendors is major pain in the ass,
so I finally decided to clean up shop a little bit.

Ever since I started using Fastmail I pretty much stopped using the other email
vendors that I had accounts with. I kept them around for unclear reasons
(e.g. maybe they'd introduce some killer new feature or maybe I'd find some use
for each of them down the road), but at some point I almost forgot about them
and would only be reminded when someone sent me an email using a vendor I don't
really monitor. Needless to say it always took me a while to figure out that
something like this had happened.

In the end I've decided to kill my Hey and Proton subscriptions and focus
entirely on Fastmail. Yeah, I still have accounts with Google, Apple and
Microsoft, but I never really use them for email.

Playing with different email services was certainly fun and I did learn a lot from
Hey, but it feels nice to have a simpler email setup. Moving on to my next mania!
