Can't wait for
[Octopress 3.0](http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/)
to be released! Octopress 2 is killing me and I was seriously
considering going back to a plain Jekyll blog, before I saw 3.0 is right around the corner.

Any day now...

**Update:** Never got to upgrade to Octopress 3.0. Eventually (3 years later), [I went back to Jekyll]({% post_url 2011-04-23-moving-to-jekyll %}). If only I had done this earlier!
