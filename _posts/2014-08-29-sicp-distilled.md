[SICP Distilled](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751759988/sicp-distilled)
is one of the most interesting Kickstarter projects I've seen in a
while.

Its creator [Tom Hall](http://www.thattommyhall.com/) is
planning to create some nice companion resources for [SICP](http://sicpebook.wordpress.com/) with code
examples in Clojure. In his own words:

> Itâ€™s a long book, with lots
> of exercises and lots of people I know have started, loved it, but
> somehow not finished.
>
> Abelson and Sussman themselves highlight the important lessons of SICP
> in their paper `Lisp: A Language For Stratified Design` and I have my
> own favourite bits.
>
> As the book itself is available online for free I want to make the
> perfect accompaniment to it - an ebook summarising the key ideas,
> short videos describing them, screencasts of solving some of the
> exercises, translation of the examples into Clojure, example projects,
> partial solutions for you to complete (similar to `4clojure` and `Clojure
> koans`) and a place to discuss solving them with people and hopefully
> keep momentum and get it finished!
>
> Something to be enjoyed alongside SICP, rather than completely replace it.
>
> Maybe some ideas come out a little different in Clojure, or I take a
> slightly novel approach (hence idiosyncratic), maybe I miss something
> out (hence tour, sorry), but I hope we can have some fun along the
> way.

I'm one of those many people who never did finish SICP (although I
hope to do that some day), so I can totally relate to Tom's
words. I've already backed his campaign and I hope more of you will do
the same!
