Today we'll discuss the following section from the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide):

For those of you who don't know of the case equality operator `===` -
it's the magic behind `case` that allows us to write code like this:

``` ruby
case something
when Array then ...
when 1..100 then ...
when /some_regexp/ then ...
end
```

Ruby will convert the above code to something like:

``` ruby
case something
when Array === something then ...
when 1..100 === something then ...
when /some_regexp/ === something then...
end
```

For many classes (like `Fixnum` and `String`) `===` will behave the
same way as `==`.  On the other hand - `Module`, `Range` and `Regexp`
define customized versions of the operator method `===`.  Knowing how
these 3 classes have defined `===`, the case expression is also
equivalent to this one:

``` ruby
case something
when something.is_a? Array then ...
when 1..100.include? something then ...
when something =~ /some_regexp/ then ...
end
```

So far everything is peachy, right?

The problem with the `===` is that when some people see it they decide
it's very _cool_ and start using it all over their code instead of
its much clearer alternatives. I've seen `===` (ab)used quite often for **instance of** checks.

``` ruby
# wtf, why doesn't this work???
# extremely common mistake I've seen numerous times
return unless a === Array

# === is defined in Module
return unless Array === a # same as Array.===(a)
```

I've also seen it used many times for range inclusion
tests. Fortunately nobody has decided so far that `===` is preferable
to `=~` for regular expressions.

It should be our utmost goal as programmers to produce clear and
easily digestible code. This means we should abstain ourselves from
doing clever tricks like:

``` ruby
Array === something
(1..100) === 7
/something/ === some_string
```

And bet on clarity instead:

``` ruby
something.is_a?(Array)
(1..100).include?(7)
some_string =~ /something/
```

They don't call it the **case equality operator** for no reason - it's
meant to be used internally by `case` expressions. I guess if it were
a regular method (instead of an operator method) we'd never have had
to deal with its abuse.

As usual I'm looking forward
to hearing your thoughts here and on

Code long and prosper!
