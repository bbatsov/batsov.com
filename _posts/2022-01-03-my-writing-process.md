While working on my [year in review article for 2021]({% post_url 2021-12-31-2021-the-year-in-review %}) I once again realized that my writing process is very similar to my programming process.[^1] Simply put - it involves many iterations and refinements and the final version is often quite different from the initial version.

Usually I'd write the first draft of an article in an hour or so (depending on
its length, of course) and I'll quickly publish it. Afterwards I'd make numerous
changes over the course of the day/week until I'm truly happy with the contents
and the structure of the article. Some of the changes are driven by external
feedback (just like a code review), some are driven by my internal desire to
polish and refine the wording of my thoughts. I also make a ton of typos and I have
to fix them at some point.

Sometimes I revisit articles I wrote months or even years ago and I do small
changes and improvements to them as well.[^2] I'm definitely not the type of person
who gets articles right from the first try. I'm also not the type of programmer
who comes up with great solutions from the first try. I am a big believer, however,
that we have to start with something that gets the job done and improve it from there.

Time for a short summary. My writing process is somewhat messy and incremental and my articles are never truly done.
I wonder if my writing process would have been different if I weren't a programmer. I guess I can never know that.

[^1]: I kept editing and extending this article over the course of 4 days.
[^2]: At this point I only make cosmetic changes, though. I'd never alter the essence of what I've originally written, even if I no longer feel the same way or agree with myself.
