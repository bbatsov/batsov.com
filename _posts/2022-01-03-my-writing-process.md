While working on my [year in review article for 2021]({% post_url 2021-12-31-2021-the-year-in-review %}) I once again realized that my writing process is very similar to my programming process.[^1] Simply put - it involves many iterations and refinements and the final version is often quite different from the initial version.

Usually I'd write the first draft of an article in an hour or so (depending on
its length, of course) and I'll quickly publish it. Afterwards I'd make numerous changes
over the course of the day/week until I'm truly happy with the contents and the structure of the
article. Some of the changes I driven by external feedback (just like code review), some are driven by my internal desire to polish and refine the wording of my toughts.

Sometimes I revisit articles I wrote months or even years ago and I do small
changes and improvements to them as well. I'm definitely not the type of person
who gets articles right from the first try. I'm also not the type of programmer
who comes up with great solutions from the first try. I am a big believer, however,
that we have to start with something that gets the job done and improve it from there.

I wonder if my writing process would have been different if I weren't a programmer. I guess I can never know that.

[^1]: I kept editing and extending this article over the course of 4 days.
