I'm happy to report that now you can use permalinks to the rules listed in the
community [Ruby](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and [Rails](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide) style guides.

Here's an
[example](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#indent-when-to-case).
Now you can easily refer to rules in heated style debates with your
friends and co-workers. :-)

This is an addition that was way overdue (for which I take all the
blame). I'd like to say a big `THANKS!!!` to [Tod Beardsley](https://github.com/todb) who
found the time I never did and got the job done (in style).

**P.S.** Hopefully soon the permalinks will be leveraged by RuboCop.
