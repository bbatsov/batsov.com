Another year is behind us and I guess it's time to write the
obligatory year in review post about it.

## The Bad Stuff

The bad stuff hasn't really changed much from [last year]({% post_url 2023-01-08-2022-the-year-in-review %}):

- The war in Ukraine still rages on and the end is nowhere in sight. It also seems that the resolve to support Ukraine is waivering across the world, which is quite disappointing. At least we finally managed to spend some time with my wife's family who came to visit us in Bulgaria during the summer.
- The global economic downturn continues as well. The IT sectors has been heavily affected, including the company that I work for. It has been the hardest year on the job in a very long time.
- Once again I didn't do much (anything?) on the self-development front. Shocker, right?
- "The Wheel of Time" ruined another year of reading for me. I got to the 10th book, so at least the end is in sight.
- My attempts to replace Twitter/X have failed and for now I've resigned myself to the idea that it doesn't have a real alternative.

On top of this I really lacked inspiration to write, so it was a pretty [bad year for blogging]({% post_url 2023-12-23-a-bad-year-for-blogging %}).

I hoped that I'd do more conference appearances this year, but ended up doing just one.

## The Good Stuff

Not much to report here - again things have changed much since last year. Same old on the OSS front, less wine and more travel.

The highlight of the year for me were a couple of vacation trips to Spain and France and a couple of team trips. I finally made it to Burgundy, which is quite the achievement for any wine lover!

## Everything Else

- I've stopped buying wallets, after getting [The Finnigan](https://www.lostdutchmanleather.com/products/the-finnigan) by Lost Dutchman Leather. I like it so much, that I've decided my quest for the perfect slim wallet is finally over.
- On the other hand - I did spent an unreasonable amount of time watching and reading mechanical watch reviews. And I added a couple more to my small watch collection. And several cheap vintage digital Casios, which are insanely cool! And plenty of straps! Watches are a very dangerous hobby, so I really hope I'll get bored with it quickly. At least it helped me leave the grip of smartwatches and brought a bit more calmness to my days.
- I'm still using the Pixel 6A as my primary phone and I'm now pondering whether to stick to Android going forward or switch back to iPhone now that they have finally embraced USB-C. Overall both the Pixel and Android have exceeded my expectation.
- I didn't buy pretty much any new gadgets this year, so I'm pretty proud of myself in that regard.
- One year later I can say I'm quite pleased with my Apple TV box, although the difference between it and Google TV is fairly slim.
- The only truly memorable TV show for me this year was "The Bear". I'd say this was a pretty bad year for good TV and movies. That being sad I did waste a lot of time on "The Last Kingdom" and "Vikings". I love historical dramas and both started pretty strong, but sadly ran out of gas fairly quickly. I didn't even bother to watch "Vikings" until the end.

## Goals for 2024

Haven't figured them out yet.

## Epilogue

And that's a wrap. One less item in my person to-do list!

Right now I'm not particularly inspired to write, but knowing me probably I'll revisit this post a few times
over the new next couple of days and extend it a bit. Or not.

I hope you've had a great 2023 and that 2024 will be even better for you!
