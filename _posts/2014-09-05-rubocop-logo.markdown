Meet [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)'s brand new official logo!

![RuboCop Logo](/images/articles/rubocop-logo.png)

RuboCop's logo was created by
[Dimiter Petrov](https://www.chadomoto.com/) (the best designer I've
ever worked with!). You can find the logo in various formats
[here](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/tree/master/logo).
