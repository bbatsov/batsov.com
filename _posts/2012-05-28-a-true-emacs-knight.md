Here's one true Emacs Knight (courtesy of my friend Gergana
Stancheva).

It was originally created to serve as the avatar of my
[@emacs_knight](https://twitter.com/emacs_knight) Twitter account, but it's way
too cool to be confined to this single use.

Feel free to use it wherever you see fit. Batman & M-x forever!
