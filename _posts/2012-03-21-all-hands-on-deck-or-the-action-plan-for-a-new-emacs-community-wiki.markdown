## Prelude

Yesterday I wrote a highly
[controversial article about the state of the EmacsWiki](http://batsov.com/articles/2012/03/20/die-emacswiki/)
and suggested a few things we can do to make things better. I got the
usual batch of hate mail and some remarks on the poor quality of my
English and writing style (which generally amuse me a lot). But I
got much more encouraging feedback from **a lot** of Emacs community
members. So here our story continues...

## On The Essence of Things

Some people accused me that I don't even know what I wiki is. To them
I'd like to say that a thing is not its dictionary/encyclopedia
definition. A thing is what it's perceived to be. People expect wiki
entries to look and behave like those found in MediaWiki or Confluence
and not like some mixture of a wiki, forum and irc conversation...

## A Word from Our Sponsor

Alex wrote a
[public response on the EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2012-03-20)
yesterday, that I'd first like to share (since probably more people
will see it here, than there). I publish it here with no alternations:

Here's my two cents on the letter:

* The markup format hardly matters. A new wiki engine would give us
better structure of the wiki as whole (like separate discussion pages
for one).

* Dropping it from the wiki doesn't mean we'll delete the code
forever. What I meant was - dump all the extensions to some archive
for the interested parties and remove them from the wiki. You're
basically putting words in my mouth.

* We should care for the bad choices some people made (like Drew - all
my respect to his work). With so many free project hosting services I
don't feel we'll be taking something away and not giving an alternative.

*  No, I don't volunteer. Not for this format of the wiki. But I do
volunteer for an alternative matching the outline I've suggested.

* Mocking me is not right response, you know. The problem exists, you
fail to acknowledge it, but I don't care that much.

* Alex calls it hyperbole, I call it the simple truth (and many others
would second me).

## The Plan

Many people commented that my post is not worth a damn if I'm not
willing to back it with action. I'm sad to disappoint my critics - but
I'll willing to go the whole nine yards on this one. Here's the
outline of my proposal for a new wiki:

1. Use [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/) as the wiki engine. It's written in Python and
it's GPL software. It doesn't use a database, it's featureful and
mature. It's successfully used by Debian and Ubuntu (and many other
respectable software organizations). I'm against using a Git backed
systems since it will increase the entry bar for user
participation. I'm even more against the use of a custom platform
developed specially to serve as the EmacsWiki.

2. I'll pay for the hosting and the new domain and set up the wiki
initially. I'd suggest that the new project begins with the domain
emacswiki.net or emacswiki.info and eventually we'll assume the old
emacswiki.org domain as well (should the new wiki be successful
enough). Suggestions for another name are welcome in the comments
section.

3. I and anyone willing to lend a hand will pick the articles worth
saving from the EmacsWiki and migrate them to the new one. I and
anyone willing to serve as moderator will monitor new contributions
afterwards.

4. Wiki entries will have a more or less standard structure and will
adhere and community established guidelines.

5. The old EmacsWiki will eventually be retired to another domain such
as old.emacswiki.org (or similar) for historic purposes and benefit of
users of old Emacs versions.

It this good enough for you to call it an action plan? Comments on it
are most welcome!

## Epilogue

I'm sorry that I'm the guy that has to break the terrible news to all of
the delusional EmacsWiki supporters out there - _It's not
special. It's not a beautiful or unique snowflake. It's the same
decaying wiki matter like some many else._ I'm sorry for my terrible
English and my lack of good manners. I'm sorry I'm willing do to
something while so many of you are just whining and ignoring the
existing problems.

I think as a member of the Emacs community I've shown my worth so far
and I'll willing to do even more. But I cannot carry out such a
massive undertaking on my own. I encourage everyone serious about
helping out to comment the article (here, not on reddit or hacker
news) or send me a personal email.

**Update**

The new wiki is now available at
[http://wikemacs.org](http://wikemacs.org). It's using MediaWiki (it
turned out it had several nice advantages over MoinMoin).
