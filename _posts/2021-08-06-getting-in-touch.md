From time to time people ask me what's the best way to get in touch with me, as there
are way too many options.

Today we're all on half a dozen social networks, plus another half a dozen of
messaging (chat) services. I don't know about you, but I really hate juggling
all of them and sometimes miss the days of e-mail, IRC and no social networks. I'm an
old-school person who loves the simplicity of e-mail and I encourage all of you
who want to get in touch with me to just write me an e-mail.  I promise to
answer all of you, although I don't promise to do so in a timely fashion. :-)

I welcome all feedback and ideas about articles, projects and talks, and any good conversation about
Emacs, Lisp, Life, the Universe and everything in between.

I have a couple of e-mail addresses for you to choose from:

* `bozhidar`/`bug` at `batsov.net` (this is my primary e-mail address these days; note that I also have the same e-mails at `batsov.com` and `batsov.dev`)
* `bozhidar@hey.com` (great for fans of HEY I guess)

Historically I was a heavy Gmail user, but recently I migrated my e-mail [from Gmail to Fastmail](https://metaredux.com/posts/2021/07/31/hasta-la-vista-gmail.html).
With Fastmail and HEY I enjoy using e-mail communication more than ever.

Apart from e-mail you can also get in touch with me on:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbatsov) (my favorite social network)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov) (via issues, PRs and discussions on my projects)
* Discord (that's the only chat I enjoy these days and I use it as a support channel for CIDER and RuboCop)

I hope it goes without saying that if you need to report bugs or get some support for some of my projects then
GitHub and Discord are the best options for you. I don't mind discussing such things over e-mail, but I think
that having such conversations in public helps the entire community around a project (e.g. it becomes much
easier to find solutions to your problems).

It's funny how as I get older I appreciate the saying "Less is more" more and more. I've also
started to appreciate way more open standards and privacy. Their combination feels quite liberating!

That's all I have for you today. Looking forward to hearing from you!
