# Overture
In the previous article of the series I've been discussing modern
alternatives of the Java programming language. The Java 7 platform is
just around the corner and so it happens that it brings us some
language improvements as well as the usual JVM and standard library
improvements. While the changes to the language are not something
major (the really good stuff like support for closures was left for
Java 8) I think they warrant a discussion. Java's popularity is
immense and as much I like alternative solutions like Scala and
Clojure the truth is that probably Java.next() will be the next
version of Java. :-)

I'll use this article to discuss overall improvements and novelties in
the Java 7 platform as well, so even if you're not interested in the
**language** you might happen to read here something interesting about
the platform.
