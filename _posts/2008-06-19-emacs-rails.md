Lately, I’ve started digging more and more into Rails, preparing for
the start of a Rails powered project. Although there are some IDEs
offering decent Rails support (namely RubyMine, NetBeans, Komodo and
Aptana Studio) I have always preferred the comfort of Emacs for
various reasons. So naturally I embarked on a quest to setup a
suitable environment for Rails development in Emacs. After a couple of
days of searching and evaluating possible solutions I finally set up a
worthy environment. It consists of a couple of components:

* [ruby-mode](http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/misc/ruby-mode.el?view=log)
* [inf-ruby](http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/misc/inf-ruby.el?view=log)
* [autopair-mode](http://code.google.com/p/autopair/)
* [nxhtml-mode](http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html)
* [yasnippet](http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/)
* [rinari](http://rinari.rubyforge.org/)

As you probably have guessed by now `ruby-mode` provides support for
editing ruby source files. The mode is pretty feature complete and
under active development, headed by none other than Matz (Ruby's
creator) himself. I can only assume that Matz is an Emacs user
himself. You can get it from the ruby svn repository if you're using a
version of Emacs older than Emacs 23 (it's built-in there).

`inf-ruby` is a mode that spawns and inferior ruby process (e.g. an `irb` shell)
to which you can directly send code from the ruby buffer you're
currently editing. For instance - you can define a function and while
your cursor is inside it you can press `C-M-x` - the function definition
will be evaluated in `irb` automatically and you can test it there. This
is extremely handy!

`autopair-mode` provides auto insertion of closing braces, quotes,
ends, etc. It's a much more generic version of the `ruby-electric` mode
that used to do similar tasks, but just in Ruby buffers.

Although many people recommend adding `pabbrev` (a mode which
provides auto-completion) to the setup, I don’t recommend it – I find
the mode mostly annoying and stick to the old school dumb
auto-completion with `M-/`. If you're shopping for auto-completion,
however, a much better and smarter choice would be a
[RSense](http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/).

`yasnippet` is a package that offers dynamically expandable code
snippets(template), quite similar to ones in TextMate. It's very easy
to add your very own snippets if you wish to.

`nxhtml-mode` is a pretty comprehensive package for web development in
general. We need it for its excellent support for erb
templates (`.rhtml`, `.erb.html`) and of course xhtml and css. Lately it's
not been as actively developed as it used to be, but it's still a
pretty good mode. Alternatively you can use
[Haml](https://github.com/nex3/haml) and
[SASS](https://github.com/antonj/scss-mode) and forget about
nxhtml. Both have pretty decent Emacs modes available.

`rinari` is a mode for Rails development – it contains rich
functionality such as the ability to easily navigate between models,
views and controllers in a Rails apfplication amongst other
features. Instructions how to set up rinari together with nxhtml-mode
can be found on rinari’s home page.

It’s always a good idea to add [ecb](http://ecb.sourceforge.net/) (the Emacs code browser) to the mix,
though this is entirely optional.

A lot of the stuff I discussed here are part of the
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) that I
develop and maintain. I urge you to use the Emacs Prelude as a starting point to
develop your very own customized version of Emacs. Prelude comes with a
few `ruby-mode` customizations, `yari` (`ri` integration for Emacs), haml and
sass modes, `autopair`, `yaml-mode`, `yasnippet`, `css-mode`, `ecb` and a lot of
other goodies ([Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) being one of my favourites).

I hope you enjoy this setup and it helps boost your Rails productivity in Emacs.
