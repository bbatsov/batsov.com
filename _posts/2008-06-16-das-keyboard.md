Every professional developer knows how important to the development
process the keyboard is, so it is only natural to be on the look for
some quality piece of hardware. After a long research in the area of
good keyboards I decided to upgrade my current rig to the recently
released [Das Keyboard 3](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Das_Keyboard_III).

Das Keyboard comes in three flavours - Professional (mechanical
keyboard with labelled keys), Ultimate (the original mechanical
keyboard with blank keys) and Silent (mechanical keyboard with labelled
keys that doesn't produce the trademarked clicking sound of the
original Das Keyboard).[^1]

I bought the Ultimate model, of course. I've been a touch typist for
several years now and I didn't really care about the labelled
keys (though I did miss them in games). Two words describe this
keyboard perfectly - **bad ass**. It's without a doubt the single
finest piece of keyboard hardware that I've touched, it's very
comfortable, very solid and I feel that I've actually improved my
typing speed with it. My colleagues don't like the noisy work of the
keyboard very much, but I have no problems with it. I actually have
grown quite fond of it.

The keyboard also features a two port USB hub, that I didn't really
consider when I was buying it, but it turned out quite helpful. I've
actually stopped using the USB ports of my computer entirely (except
for input devices) - I use the keyboard hub to plug-in flash drives
and charge devices. When your computer is sitting beneath a desk you
learn to appreciate USB hubs very quickly.

I have long heard stories about Das Keyboard's quality
and comfort and it has totally lived up to its hype. The price is
admittedly a bit steep (I bought two keyboards (for home and for work),
each costing $130), but this is our hands and productivity we're
talking about so we shouldn't be cheap. So what are
you waiting for - research the market yourselves and make your pick! Your
hands deserve a quality keyboard (the Das Keyboard)!

[^1]: The clicky versions have Cherry MX Blue keyswitches and the "silent" version has Cherry MX Brown.

**Update:** Down the road I've switched to Das Keyboard 4, KUL ES-87 and
eventually to the [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C). As of 2020 I still believe
that the Leopold is the best keyboard I've ever experienced and I'd recommend
it to everyone looking for the ultimate typing experience!
