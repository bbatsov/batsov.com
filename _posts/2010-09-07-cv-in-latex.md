After a long period of planning I finally migrated my professional CV
from Word to LaTeX last weekend. Since I live in the European Union I
used the [europecv](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/europecv/) LaTeX class.

I’ve uploaded the LaTeX code into [GitHub](http://github.com/bbatsov/cv) feel free to borrow it for
your CVs if you like it. You’ll have to compile the **master.tex** file
with **pdflatex** to get a nicely formatted pdf version of the CV.
