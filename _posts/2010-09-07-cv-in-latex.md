After a long period of planning I finally migrated my professional CV
from Word to LaTeX last weekend. Since I live in the European Union I
used the [europecv](https://ctan.org/pkg/europecv?lang=en) LaTeX class.

I’ve uploaded the LaTeX code to [GitHub](http://github.com/bbatsov/cv). Feel free to borrow it for
your CVs if you like it. You’ll have to compile the `master.tex` file
with `pdflatex` to get a nicely formatted pdf version of the CV.
