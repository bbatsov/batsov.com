This is going to be one super short post.

A couple of years ago I disabled the comments here for [various reasons]({% post_url 2021-11-02-blog-comments-are-dead %}). Given my overall positive experience with [Hyvor Talk]({% post_url 2020-12-08-farewell-disqus %}) as a comments service for my other blogs I thought it might be a good idea to enable it here as well. So, I finally took the time to figure out how to make it work with my current Jekyll theme (Minimal Mistakes). Turns out the configuration was trivial and the whole thing took me less than 5 minutes.

Blog comments are back. Use them... or not.
