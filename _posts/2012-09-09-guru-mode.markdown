Getting started with Emacs is hard. That's a fact of life and you
shouldn't believe anyone telling you otherwise.

One of the harder parts of the journey to Emacs mastery is remembering
all those keybindings at the beginning (`C-h t`), which can be really
overwhelming. To make matters worse for many common commands there are
two sets of keybindings - the Emacs ones (that are touch typing
friendly) and the popular ones (that typically involve the use of the
arrow keys). Most people never get to use the *proper* keybindings and
forever make use of the arrow keys.

To help Emacs newcomers get used to the proper Emacs keybindings I've
created [guru-mode](http://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode) - a simple
minor mode that will show you a (helpful) message in the minibuffer
every time you try to use a *non Emacs way* keybinding.

It will probably annoy you **a lot** in the beginning, but trust me -
it'll be worth it in the long run.

`guru-mode` comes bundled with
[Emacs Prelude](http://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) and is available
for installation from [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org) and [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net).

P.S. True Emacs mastery cannot be achieved if you do not practice
touch typing; if you're doing hunt-and-peck typing you'd better fire up the
venerable `gtypist` before looking at `guru-mode`.
