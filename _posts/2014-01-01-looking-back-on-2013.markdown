2013 was a good year for me in many aspects. I'll share here some of
the programming-related achievements of mine over the year that made
me somewhat proud of myself.

## Achievements

### Ruby

#### RuboCop

I've made great headway with the
[RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analyzer
over the year. Working on a big non-Rails Ruby project reminded me
why I fell in love with Ruby in the first place. I was also amazed by
great community that quickly formed around RuboCop and propelled it to
popularity. I hope that in 2014 I'll be able to deliver a 1.0 release.

#### Blogging

I finally did some Ruby-related blogging this year - mostly regarding
good programming style. I enjoyed it, although I noticed it's much
harder for me to blog, than it is to code. Good thing I became a
programmer and not a writer I guess!

### Emacs

I spent a lot of time working on Emacs-related stuff over the year:

* I started a new Emacs blog called [Emacs Redux](http://emacsredux.com)
* I improved a lot [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
and [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile)
* I contributed code to Emacs for the first time
* I took over the maintenance of [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
* I was involved in a lesser role in the development of many cool Emacs extensions

### Clojure

I wrote a
[Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide)
at the beginning of the year. I also hoped I'd be able to work on
static code analyzer for Clojure similar to RuboCop, but I got
sidetracked and this did not happen. I did lots of CIDER-related work
over the year and I hope I'll be able improve CIDER significantly in
2014 (I have so many great ideas about it!).

Clojure is still my favorite programming language and hope in 2014 I'll be
able to work on more Clojure projects.

### Misc

I spent some time playing with algorithms and math for the first time
in a long while (inspired by Coursera).  This was lots of fun! I hope
that in 2014 I'll be able to allocate even more time to studying them
properly.

## Epilogue

In previous years I generally spent a lot of time studying/researching new
programming related stuff - new languages, new frameworks, new tools,
new paradigms, etc. Conversely, I spent relatively little time hacking
on open-source projects. 2013 was quite different for me - very little
research, lots of open-source hacking. It was pretty tiresome at times, but
also extremely enjoyable and gratifying experience.

No idea how 2014 will turn out, but I hope it will be at least as fun
as 2013 was!
