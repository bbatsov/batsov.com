Today I've learned about [edamagit](https://github.com/kahole/edamagit), a super
faithful port of Magit for VS Code. It looks pretty similar to Magit and even has
the same keybindings as Magit (e.g. you display it with `M-x g`).

I've played with it a bit and it definitely makes using Git in VS Code a lot more fun. If for some reason you have to use VS Code this will make you feel right at home.

Here are a couple of useful resources to get you started with `edamagit`:

* [Tutorial Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDISNtPYhjk)

I don't know about you, but I always feel great when I see that an Emacs package is
so innovative and awesome that users of other editors try to replicate its functionality in their editor of choice. It seems there's still a spark of brilliance in our "ancient" community! M-x forever!
