Several months passed since I stated my intent
[to shutdown WikEmacs](articles/2013/01/27/the-wikemacs-experiment-is-over-long-live-emacswiki/). While
I still consider the project a failed experiment and stand by
everything I wrote in that post, I have received since lots of messages from
people who were sad to see WikEmacs go. One person in particular,
[Jesse Johnson](https://twitter.com/holocronweaver), was committed to
seeing the project move forward and offered to take over its stewardship.

In the end I've decided that in spirit of the FOSS ideals I don't have
the right to take away something people like and want to use(especially
given the fact that they contributed most of the content there) and
handed over the domain and the data to Jesse.

[WikEmacs](http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Main_Page) has been running
for a couple of weeks now under his management and will continue to
exist for a long time. If you liked the project I guess this is a good
moment to show you love and spread the word.
