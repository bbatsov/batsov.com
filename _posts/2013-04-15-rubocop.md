After I launched the
[Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide) I
often received requests to create a tool enforcing the rules in the guide
automatically.

Today this tool is a reality - meet
[RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop). RuboCop already covers
a significant portion of the style guide, supports both MRI 1.9 and MRI 2.0
and has pretty neat Emacs integration (via
[rubocop.el](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-emacs) and
[flycheck](https://github.com/lunaryorn/flycheck)).[^1]

Getting started with RuboCop is as easy as we:

``` shell
$ gem install rubocop
$ cd some-project
$ rubocop
```

I'd love to see more Ruby hackers check out RuboCop!

I'd also like to thank all the great people who contributed code, issue
reports and ideas to RuboCop's development and I sincerely hope many
Ruby hackers will find it useful!

[^1]: No tool is truly useful until it has proper Emacs integration.
