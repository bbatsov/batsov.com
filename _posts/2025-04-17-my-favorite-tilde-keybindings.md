I'm a big fan of the `~` (tilde) key and I make heavy
use of it every day. That's why I've never been fond
of keyboards that move its position for whatever reason.[^1]

I've discovered `Control + ~` almost 20 years ago, in the days
when I was using Linux and GNOME, and it was my preferred way
to summon a GNOME Terminal. Many years later, I'm still using
the same keybinding, and I've discovered a few extra uses for
`~` along the way.

**Note:** I'm guessing these days `Control + ~` is way more popular than it used to
be, as VS Code is also using it for its built-in terminal.

## macOS

- `Control + ~` - open dropdown terminal (these days I use Ghostty)
- `Option + ~` - open main (full) terminal window
  - As you can't do this directly in macOS, I'm using an Alfred workflow for this
- `Command + ~` - cycle app windows (that's a global macOS keybinding)
  - Super useful command, that for some reason I discovered only recently. (or I had forgotten a long time ago)

I guess it's no surprise that I'm not a VS Code user, at least not often.

## Linux

- `Control + ~` - open dropdown terminal
- `Alt + ~` - cycle app windows (that a global keybinding in GNOME, not sure about KDE)

Obviously, we're short one modifier key here, but that's not a big deal in practice.

## Epilogue

That's it! A very short article on a very basic topic.

What are your favorite `~`-powered keybindings?
