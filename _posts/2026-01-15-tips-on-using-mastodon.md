I've started using Mastodon over 3 years ago, in the aftermath of Twitter's
meltdown. At first I didn't like it much, as there were a few things about it
I found frustrating:

- You had to pick some instance to join (or host your own), so I spent quite a
  bit of time looking into various instances
- The default web UI was not my cup of tea - I found it to be complex and
  unwieldy. This was probably the main reason I didn't enjoy using Mastodon at
  first.
- The interaction metrics (boosts, likes, etc) were often out-of-sync in
  different clients. That was improved in recent versions of Mastodon, but it
  was definitely surprising to me coming from Twitter.

## Picking an instance

Eventually I realized the simplest things you can do to have a nice Mastodon
experience is to pick some reasonably popular instance (so you known it's
stable and won't disappear after a while) and some decent third-party client. I
never read the local timeline, so in the end I don't think it matters much
which instance you're end up using. If you don't want to waste time researching
instances just go with the "default" [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social)
instance.  You can certainly do a lot worse, and of course, you can always move
your account to another Mastodon instance down the road.

## Picking a client

When it comes to clients, I've played with quite a few and enjoyed the most the following:

- [Mona](https://apps.apple.com/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653) (native app for all Apple devices)
- [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) (same as Mona, but with a simpler user interface)
- [Phanpy](https://phanpy.social/) (simple and sleek web client)

I've used Mona for about a year before switching to Ivory. Mona's a good app
overall, but I experienced some stability issues with it and I felt the UI was
a bit cluttered.  That's why eventually I moved to Ivory. (plus I like their
logo better) Both Mona and Ivory are proprietary apps and require a
subscription to have access to all their features, but these are money well
spent IMO. I really like desktop apps, so Mona and Ivory made my interactions
with Mastodon way more pleasant (and frequent). Not that the webapps are bad, I
just don't like having a ton of pinned windows in my browser.

## Hashtags

One more thing - embrace hashtags in Mastodon! Twitter had made those popular in its early days,
but eventually moved away from them. They are quite alive in Mastodon and I use
them extensively to follow topics that are important to me. (e.g. posts about
various programming languages) So, it's a good to use them in your posts, so
other people can discover your post via the hashtags.

That's all from me on the topic for now. I hope you've learned something useful.
In the Fediverse we trust!
