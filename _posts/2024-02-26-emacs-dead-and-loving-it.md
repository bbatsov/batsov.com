Emacs was originally created in 1976. I was born in 1984. I've been using Emacs
as my primary editor since 2005. Back then GNU Emacs was still reeling from the
schism with XEmacs[^1] and a lot of people felt that the project might be near
the end of its long and storied history. I recall the Emacs development wasn't
moving particularly fast at the time, modern text editors and IDEs
(e.g. TextMate and Eclipse) were on the rise, and there were quite a few article
proclaiming the death of Emacs. Yet Emacs is still here 19 years later and some
of the editors and IDEs that were popular in 2005 are not. This year Emacs will turn 48 years,
which is an amazing achievement for any piece of software!

Last week another [thread on Emacs's
death](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1avn7ox/is_emacs_dying/) created
some ripples in the Emacs community. I didn't even read it, because it's always
more or less the same:

- Emacs is too complicated (different) for people used to "modern" editors
- Emacs is not as popular as X, Y and Z
- Emacs is old, so it's probably (technologically) outdated
- Lisp sucks, let's just use JavaScript everywhere

Highly subjective personal preferences aside, people often conflate how popular
something is with how good or lively it actually is. If you look at the market
share of Emacs, things definitely don't look great:[^2]

On the other hand, both the upstream Emacs development and [the ecosystem of
third-party packages](https://melpa.org) feel to me more active than ever. At a time
when some people are ready to write off Emacs as dead yet again, I'd be more inclined to
pronounce a "Golden Age of Emacs".

I've written [at length about the merits of Emacs]({% post_url 2021-11-16-why-emacs-redux %}) in the past, so I'm not going to repeat myself here.
I'll just remind you about the old saying "Don't judge a book by its cover". Or by it's popularity or marketing
campaigns for that matter. Essence is what matters, not superficial appearances.

Emacs is certainly a very strange editor by modern standards. I'm guessing
that's the main reason so many people quickly dismiss it. But it's remarkable
resilience is an indication that's it's probably made of stronger stuff than
most editors. If you want to invest into a tool that has stood the test of time
and will probably continue to be useful 50 years down the road - your options besides
Emacs are quite limited.

It's true that Emacs was at one point one of the two most popular text editors in the world.
Still, today it probably has a lot more users in absolute terms than in the 80s and early 90s.
World domination is not a big priority for Emacs, but it may still be in the cards, given
the average lifespan of many of its competitors.

Emacs is no more dead than usual and it likes it that way. M-x forever!
