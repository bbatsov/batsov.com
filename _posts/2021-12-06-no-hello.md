I've always hated filler chat/email messages like "Hello! How are you doing?",
so I'm very glad we have sites like [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/) where
we can point people who are in the habit of using them.

> It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial salutatory reply also allows for asynchronous communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.

Can't agree more! I always cut right to the chase with my messages and advise everyone to do the same.
