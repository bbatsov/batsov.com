I'm planning to release the long overdue [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) 0.8 at [clojure/conj](http://clojure-conj.org/) 2014.
I'll be giving a talk there that will be mostly about CIDER, so this seems like a pretty good idea to me.

I'd like to ask you to do a bit of extra testing to the current
snapshot builds, so we can deliver a solid release (if we're lucky -
the most solid ever). Guess you should pay extra attention to the
[new features](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you want to get some issue fixed in time for 0.8 you'd better [get started right away](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues).

Thanks in advance for your help!
