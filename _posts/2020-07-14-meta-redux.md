This site was my first attempt to write. I failed miserably and I produced some pretty
crappy content, but I also learned a lot in the process.

Over the course of a decade the blog saw quite a few transformations and shifts in my focus and interests.
For a few years it was named `DevCraft`[^1] and it was hosted on wordpress.com. Afterwards
I adopted the `(think)` title and switched to Jekyll, Octopress and then again to Jekyll.
Originally I was writing mostly tutorials on topics like Linux, Java, Emacs and Ruby, but eventually I started writing some essays
as well (my favorite type of posts). As my OSS portfolio grew it started to gain
significant coverage in my blog as well. `(think)` was a big messy and without a clear
direction, but I guess it was a somewhat accurate reflection of myself as well.

For various reasons (mostly a combination of frustration with Octopress and my (immense) laziness), I didn't write
anything between 2015 and 2018 and when I finally mustered the will to return to writing
I decided to go with a clean slate and a new blog.[^2]

These days most of my writing happens at [Meta Redux](https://metaredux.com), but
I still plan to post here things that are worth sharing, but don't fit the overall
idea of Meta Redux (where my primary focus is my OSS work and essay-like articles).

I guess I'll still be writing here on programming-related topics, but who knows...
Knowing me there's a high chance I won't actually write anything at all! There's
a good chance this will be final `(think)` article.

At any rate - it's still a lot of fun to be re-reading my old articles (especially the rants)
and comparing the person I used to be with the person I am today.
I'm starting to think that's the biggest value of running a personal blog - it's
a written account of our evolution as human beings.
