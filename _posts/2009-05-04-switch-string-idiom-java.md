I've always been frustrated with the inability to write a switch on
String in Java.  However the enum type introduced in Java 5.0 somewhat
diminishes the issue. Read this excellent
[article](http://www.xefer.com/2006/12/switchonstring) on the subject.

**Update**

Java 7 now supports switch on String!
