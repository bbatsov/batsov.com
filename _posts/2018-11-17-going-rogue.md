For many years I've enjoyed listening to programming podcasts - it's
the perfect way to make a commute a bit more fun and
educational.[^1] [RubyRogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/) was always
one of my favourite Ruby shows and I find it very amusing that
recently I ended up being their guest. I certainly didn't see this coming!
Seems that a lot has changed since the days I followed it actively, but it
was still fun to make an appearance there.

If you'd like to listen to our conversation about RuboCop, Emacs and
the future of Ruby be sure to check out [this
episode](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-388-rubocop-and-emacs-i-guess-with-bozhidar-batsov/).

Until next time!
