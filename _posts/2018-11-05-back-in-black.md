After 3 years of "waiting" for Octopress 3[^1], I've decided I waited
long enough.  Today I (spontaneously) migrated my blog to a vanilla
Jekyll setup and I tweaked a bit its appearance. I'm reasonably pleased
with the result and I finally don't have any excuses not to write.[^2]

I realized recently that it has been over 10 years since my first blog
post.[^3] I've started my humble writing "career" with Wordpress, then
switched to Octopress, and now here we are. One thing never really
changed, though - the quality of my writing. It was always abysmally
bad, as were many of the topics I wrote on. It's really fun to look
back on all of this - I was reading some of my old articles, in the
process of migrating the blog to Jekyll, and I couldn't believe some of
the things I wrote. I hope this means I'm getting wiser with age...

In the meantime I've started another blog, called [Meta
Redux](https://metaredux.com). I plan to do most of my (serious)
writing there, but I might write an occasional short article or two
here as well. My rough idea is to use Meta Redux as a platform for my
more creative writing, and to use `(think)` for random stuff, small
tips, etc.

Anyways, lately I've had this burning desire to share so many thoughts
and that really got me excited about writing. Let's see if I'll do
better this time around, or I'll simply fail one more time...
