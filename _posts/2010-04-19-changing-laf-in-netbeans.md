Recently I’ve been trying to switch my work environment theme to
something with lower contrast (namely the excellent [Zenburn
theme](https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn)). Swing applications,
however,have difficulties with GTK themes when they are using the GTK+
look & feel, so I’ve decided to go to Nimbus – the new default look &
feel for Java apps since Java 6 Update 10.

The only problem with the plan was that there is no way to change the
look and feel inside NetBeans – it had to be done by changing its
configuration. This is done fairly easy. Just find the file
`/etc/netbeans.conf` in NetBeans’s installation folder and append this to
the `netbeans_default_options` section:

`--laf Nimbus`

Now you just have to (re)start NetBeans and you can enjoy Nimbus.
