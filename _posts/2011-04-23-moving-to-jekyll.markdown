This is my first post after a very long hiatus partially induced by a
migration of my blog from WordPress to
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which I started half an
year ago and never quite finished(until today, that is).

I wasn't particularly unhappy with WordPress, but some things there
irritated me - for instance it was hard to edit my posts within my
beloved Emacs(and yes - I know all the options and I hate them
all). Accidentally I've stumbled upon the post
["Bloggin like a hacker"](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)
and I instantly knew Jekyll was what I needed. It allows me to create
my posts as simple markdown templates, allows me to embed logic
written in Ruby in them and it has built-in support for code
highlighting(using the excellent Python library *pygments*). It also
allows me to store my blog under version control in github which is
really nice.

Jekyll is not particularly well documented and I had a few problems
with it at first, but I managed to overcome them all. One thing that
will be problematic for some users is the need to add things like rss,
commenting and analytics manually(they are bundled in a solution like
WordPress). On the other hand - you're not tied to anything in
particular and may choose the service you like the most. I chose
[Disqus](http://disqus.com) for the comments and Google Analytics for the site
analytics(what a surprise).

By the way - my old blog Devcraft is no more. My new blog has a new
domain and a new theme(based on my favourite coding theme
[Zenburn](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs)).  I know that the
blog is currently pig ugly and the content is not particularly great
either, but I'll try to improve this along the way and add a lot of
interesting and hopefully useful information.
