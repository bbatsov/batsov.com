[Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) 0.12 is finally out!

<!--more-->

A lot of time has passed since the previous stable release, for which
I'm truly sorry.  I kept delaying and delaying the release for various
reasons, but it's finally here and it's pretty **big**.  Please,
consult the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
for some of the more interesting changes. Note that some changes and
new features are totally undocumented, as I haven't been as demanding
to contributors as I'm usually on my other projects (meaning I didn't
ask everyone to update the changelog or the readme).

It's funny how open-source works - I never expected that Projectile
would have any users except me, but today it's one of the most popular
3rd party Emacs extensions. Unfortunately I'm involved with many
other projects and have a pretty demanding day job, so issues and feature
requests have been piling up
lately. [80 open issues](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues) -
that's depressing! I guess I'm a pretty lame maintainer! :-)

If you like the project, I'd appreciate your assistance to bring their
number down.  Many of the requests are relatively easy to implement,
some don't make sense and should be simply closed (or might have been
fixed accidentally). Same goes for the open PRs.

That's all for me now, folks! I'll try to deliver stable releases
faster in the future, but I won't make any promises. Thanks for all
your help and support! I really appreciate them!

**P.S.** I'd love for Projectile to have a cool logo. Maybe someone can
help out with that as well?
